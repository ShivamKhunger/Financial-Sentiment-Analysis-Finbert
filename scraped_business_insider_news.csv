Investors may not see a good buying opportunity in bitcoin until the crypto's price falls around 20%, according to BCA Research. You've likely heard some of the following terms if you've paid attention to the world of finance: Cryptocurrency, Blockchain, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum. But what do they mean? And why is cryptocurrency suddenly so hot? First, we'll explain the blockchain basics. As society become increasingly digital, financial services providers are looking to offer customers the same services to which they're accustomed, but in a more efficient, secure, and cost effective way. The origins of blockchain are a bit nebulous. A person or group of people known by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakomoto invented and released the tech in 2009 as a way to digitally and anonymously send payments between two parties without needing a third party to verify the transaction. It was initially designed to facilitate, authorize, and log the transfer of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.(read more) Blockchain tech is actually rather easy to understand at its core. Essentially, it's a shared database populated with entries that must be confirmed and encrypted. Think of it as a kind of highly encrypted and verified shared Google Document, in which each entry in the sheet depends on a logical relationship to all its predecessors. Blockchain tech offers a way to securely and efficiently create a tamper-proof log of sensitive activity (anything from international money transfers to shareholder records). Blockchain's conceptual framework and underlying code is useful for a variety of financial processes because of the potential it has to give companies a secure, digital alternative to banking processes that are typically bureaucratic, time-consuming, paper-heavy, and expensive. Cryptocurrencies are essentially just digital money, digital tools of exchange that use cryptography and the aforementioned blockchain technology to facilitate secure and anonymous transactions. There had been several iterations of cryptocurrency over the years, but Bitcoin truly thrust cryptocurrencies forward in the late 2000s. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies floating out on the market now, but Bitcoin is far and away the most popular. Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies don't just fall out of the sky. Like any other form of money, it takes work to produce them. And that work comes in the form of mining. But let's take a step back. Satoshi Nakamoto, the founder of Bitcoin, ensured that there would ever only be 21 million Bitcoins in existence. He (or they) reached that figure by calculating that people would discover, or ""mine,"" a certain number of blocks of transactions each day. Every four years, the number of Bitcoins released in relation to the previous cycle gets reduced by 50%, along with the reward to miners for discovering new blocks. At the moment, that reward is 12.5 Bitcoins. Therefore, the total number of Bitcoins in circulation will approach 21 million but never actually reach that figure. This means Bitcoin will never experience inflation. The downside here is that a hack or cyberattack could be a disaster because it could erase Bitcoin wallets with little hope of getting the value back. As for mining Bitcoins, the process requires electrical energy. Miners solve complex mathematical problems, and the reward is more Bitcoins generated and awarded to them. Miners also verify transactions and prevent fraud, so more miners equals faster, more reliable, and more secure transactions. Thanks to Satoshi Nakamoto's designs, Bitcoin mining becomes more difficult as more miners join the fray. In 2009, a miner could mine 200 Bitcoin in a matter of days. In 2014, it would take approximately 98 years to mine just one, according to 99Bitcoins. Super powerful computers called Application Specific Integrated Circuit, or ASIC, were developed specifically to mine Bitcoins. But because so many miners have joined in the last few years, it remains difficult to mine loads. The solution is mining pools, groups of miners who band together and are paid relative to their share of the work. Since its inception, Bitcoin has been rather volatile. But based on its recent boom — and a forecast by Snapchat's first investor, Jeremy Liew, that it would hit $500,000 by 2030 — and the prospect of grabbing a slice of the Bitcoin pie becomes far more attractive. Bitcoin users expect 94% of all bitcoins to be released by 2024. As the number moves toward the ceiling of 21 million, many expect the profits miners once made from the creation of new blocks to become so low that they will become negligible. But as more bitcoins enter circulation, transaction fees could rise and offset this. As for blockchain technology itself, it has numerous applications, from banking to the Internet of Things. It is expected that companies will flesh out their blockchain IoT solutions. Blockchain is a promising tool that will transform parts of the IoT and enable solutions that provide greater insight into assets, operations, and supply chains. It will also transform how health records and connected medical devices store and transmit data. Blockchain won’t be usable everywhere, but in many cases, it will be a part of the solution that makes the best use of the tools in the IoT arsenal.

ETFs,"After a year of record growth, the ETF market has grown to $10.4 trillion. Experts say they expect that to continue in 2025. Passive investing has skyrocketed in popularity for its safe returns, but in the process, it's made active investing more risky, Apollo's chief economist says. Investment firms hope to launch private-credit ETFs to allow ordinary investors to access the $1.7 trillion market. Bitcoin ETFs faced net outflows for eight straight days as iInvestors shed risky assets after the latest economic data. Workers lose billions by unknowingly keeping 401(k) savings in cash instead of investing after job switch. Younger workers at risk of losing gains. ETFs, short for Exchange Traded Funds, are investment trusts traded on the stock exchange. ETFs do not have any restriction on their contract period and can therefore be permanently traded at the current stock exchange price in the same way as shares. Upon purchasing a share in a fund, the investor becomes the shareholder of the constituent parts of the fund. When purchasing an ETF the investor also participates in the development of the securities within the fund. In contrast to actively managed funds, Exchange Traded Funds are primarily passively managed. A benchmark index is reproduced as accurately as possible. Consequently, no fund manager is responsible for permanently monitoring the fund and actively adjusting it in response to the market situation, but instead the index itself determines the composition. Because there is no active management, the management fee for ETFs is generally considerably lower than for other investment funds. If shares in a fund are purchased over the stock exchange, only the costs of purchasing and selling securities over the stock exchange without an issue surcharge are to be paid.(read more) Because Exchange Traded Funds with passive management aim to reproduce a benchmark index as accurately as possible, ETFs can never outperform the development of the associated index. ETFs combine the advantages of three asset classes: shares, certificates and funds. Like shares, ETFs can be traded at any time at the current stock exchange value and are therefore a very flexible investment instrument. In addition, because they have a cost structure similar to that of certificates, they are of interest to private investors. Their composition also guarantees broad diversification, as is common for funds, which is why they are regarded as a relatively secure asset class.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/etfs
Best Savings Accounts,"The best high-yield savings accounts have a strong interest rate, good perks, and low fees. High-yield savings accounts are a good place to keep emergency money or savings for things you want to accomplish in a short timeframe. TheFederal Reserve maintained interest rates at the last Fed meeting,meaning national savings rates will likely continue to hold competitive rates. Another Fed meeting is taking place on March 18 and 19. According to theCME FedWatch Tool, there's over 70% chance the Fed will keep rates the same. Projections may change as the March Fed meeting approaches. With all that said, high-yield savings accounts are still worth opening regardless of market conditions because they pay more than traditional savings accounts. We report on the highest-yielding nationwide savings account rates currently available, as well as any local market leaders. We've listed the highest interest rates for savings accounts, as well as two high-yield accounts from popular national brands (Barclays and Santander Bank). All of the banks and credit unions listed offer at least 4.40% APY (Annual Percentage Yield), significantly higher than the national average. Featured Nationally Available Deposit Rates Earn high-yields with a new account — from banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions that use partner banks. Business Insider's personal finance team reviewed 230 savings accounts and narrowed our top picks down to 10. The top options offer no monthly maintenance fees and low minimum opening deposits. Many of thebest banksand credit unions for high-yield savings accounts are online. Our top picks for savings accounts are federally insured by the FDIC or NCUA. Federal insurance protects up to $250,000 per depositor in the event of a bank failure. Here are the best high-yield savings accounts as picked by Business Insider editors in 2025. Thehighest interest rate on a savings accountisn't offered by a nationwide financial institution — it's offered by a local credit union. The Community Financial Credit Union High Yield Savings Account offers up to 10.00% APY. You'll need to make a $5 minimum opening deposit to open the account, but once you do you'll earn 10% APY on the first $1,000 in your account. For any balance over $1,000, you'll earn 0.10% APY, which is lower than the national average saving rate of 0.41% APY, according to the FDIC. The account has no monthly service fee. To join this credit union, you'll need to live, work, attend school, or worship in Michigan, have an immediate family member who qualifies to join the credit union, or live in the household of a current member. If you own a business, you can join through your company if it regularly does business in Michigan. Community Financial Credit Union has aB- ratingfrom the BBB because it hasn't responded to one complaint filed against it. It does not have any recent controversies. TheDCU Primary Savings Accountis one of the few remaining5% interest savings accounts. You can earn 5.50% APY on balances up to $1,000 withDCU Primary Savings Account. If you have an account balance above $1,000, theinterestrate drops to 0.05% APY. This account doesn't charge monthly service fees. To open the Digital Federal Credit Union Primary Savings Account, you'll have to meet certain membership eligibility requirements. You must live in select areas of Massachusetts, live in a New Hampshire participating condominium community, work for a Select Employer Group, or belong to a local participating organization. Digital Federal Credit Union currently has anA+ ratingfrom the BBB. The credit union hasn't been involved in any recent public controversies. The Varo Savings Account is one of the last high yield savings accounts to offer 2.50% to 5.00% APY. It also comes with automatic savings tools that automatically transfer money from your paychecks and purchases to your savings account, if you choose to use them. You'll need to meet some requirements to earn the highest APY, though. First, you'll need to get at least $1,000 in direct deposits each month and end the month with a positive balance in all of your Varo bank accounts. Then, you'll earn the high APY — but only on the first $5,000 in your account. You'll earn a much lower rate on any money over that $5,000. Varo has anA- ratingfrom the BBB because of the large number of complaints filed against the bank. it has no recent controversies. TheAxos ONE Savings and Checking Bundleis a hybrid savings account and checking account, which means you can't open an Axos ONE savings account without an Axos ONE checking account. You could earn a high rate with theAxos ONE Savings and Checking Bundle; your savings account balance can earn up to up to 4.86% APY, while your checking account balance can earn up to 0.51% APY. The account also comes with other perks, likeearly direct depositand enhanced FDIC coverage. In order to earn a good interest rate, you'll need to receive at least $1,500 in direct deposits before the 25th of the month. You'll also need to maintain an average daily balance of $1,500. If you can't meet those requirements, you'll only earn 1.00% APY on your savings balance, and you won't earn any interest at all on your checking balance. Axos Bank has anA+ ratingfrom the BBB. It does not have any recent controversies. Pibank Savingsoffers one of the highest-yield savings account rate nationally. This account pays 4.60% APY, has a $0 minimum opening deposit, and no monthly service fees. If you haven't heard of Pibank before, it's an online brand of Intercredit Bank, a financial institution in Miami. While this account offer a competitive interest rate and has relatively flexible opening requirements, there a couple of downsides to take note of. Pibank Savings doesn't support payments through Bill Pay or Zelle. You also may be charged fees by your external financial institution for outgoing and incoming wire transfers. The BBB gave Intercredit Bank anA ratingbecause of a few complaints filed against the business. Pibank hasn't received an individual rating from the BBB yet. TheBrioDirect High-Yield Savings Accountoffers a competitive rate of 4.50% APY and doesn't charge monthly maintenance fees. You might consider another bank if you'd like to open a high-yield savings account with a low minimum opening deposit. The BrioDirect High-Yield Savings Account requires $5,000 to open an account. The BBB also gave BrioDirect's parent company, Webster Bank, aB- ratingbecause it received numerous customer complaints and hasn't resolved one of the complaints. Webster Bank has also been involved in a recent controversy. In January 2024, Webster paid$1.4 million in a settlementover a class action lawsuit. The lawsuit was over a ransomware attack on Webster Bank that resulted in some customers of the bank having their personal information stolen. TheLendingClub LevelUp Savings Accountcould be a good option for people planning on using it as their primary savings account. TheLendingClub LevelUp Savings Accountcomes with a minimum opening deposit of $0 and no monthly service fee, making it a good choice for people looking for a low-fee savings account. It also comes with a free ATM card, which is useful for people who don't mind using an online bank but who want to be able to withdraw cash. You'll need to meet some requirements to get the highest interest rate, though. In order to get the full 4.50% APY, you'll need to deposit at least $250 each month. If you don't, you'll earn 3.50% APY — still a good rate, but not as high as some of the other accounts on this list. LendingClub has anA+ ratingfrom the BBB. It doesn't have any recent controversies. The Vibrant Credit Union Preferred Savings account could be a good option for you if you have a small amount of savings you'd like to earn a good rate on. The account has no monthly service fee and a $0 minimum opening deposit, making it a low-fee account. You don't need to meet any special requirements to earn the highest interest rate on the first $15,000 in the account. Once your balance goes over $15,000, you'll be earning a significantly lower rate of 1.00% APY. If you're planning on keeping a significant amount of money in your savings account, you might prefer one of our other picks. Credit unions require membership to open bank accounts. You can join Vibrant Credit Union by becoming part of the Illinois Consumer Council. If you join it through a Vibrant Credit Union application, it will pay any associated fees for you. You can also join by living or working in certain parts of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, or Wisconsin, by being a member or employee of a select employee group or association, or by having a domestic partner or immediate family member who's already a member of the credit union. Vibrant Credit Union has anA+ ratingfrom the BBB. It doesn't have any recent controversies. TheNewtek Bank Personal High Yield Savings Accountoffers a high-interest savings account you can find nationally. It also has a $0 minimum opening deposit. Newtek Bank received anA+ ratingfrom the BBB. Newtek Bank doesn't have a personal checking account, and you can't get adebit cardor ATM card with a high-yield savings account. If you need to withdraw money, you'll have to transfer it to an external bank account. TheBarclays Tiered Savingsaccount pays a great interest rate if you can meet the requirements, and there's a $0 minimum deposit and no monthly maintenance fee. To earn the highest interest rate, you'll need to have at least $250,000 in your account. You'll still earn a good interest rate if you can't meet that requirement, but the lower rate isn't as good as what our other top picks offer. Additionally, FDIC insurance doesn't cover amounts over $250,000 for single depositors, so you'll have to be OK with some of your money being uninsured — or try to keep the money in your account at exactly $250,000 — if you want to earn the highest rate. The bank has been involved in one recent public controversy. In 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission required Barclays to pay $361 million in a settlement that accused the bank of having unregistered sales of securities. The Better Business Bureau gives Barclays anA+ rating. TheOpenbank High Yield Savingshas a high savings account interest rate of 4.40% (varies depending on location) APY. It doesn't charge any monthly service fees, either. TheOpenbank High Yield Savingscomes with some downsides that might not make it a good choice for you. You'll only be able to bank using Openbank's mobile banking app, and you'll need a phone that has either fingerprint or face recognition technology. If you don't have a phone with those features or don't want to use those features, you'll want to go with a different bank. You might also struggle to get money in and out of the account; you won't have access to ATMs or mobile check deposit with this account, and Openbank doesn't have a checking account you can transfer your money into easily. Openbank does not have a rating from the BBB. Its parent bank, Santander Bank, has anA+ ratingfrom the BBB. Neither Openbank nor Santander Bank have recent controversies. Openbank Savings Account Review High-yield savings accounts are a type of bank account. You can distinguish them from traditional savings accounts because they pay a higher yield. That's because they're generally offered by online banks and credit unions, so these financial institutions don't generally have to pay for all of the expenses that brick-and-mortar banks and credit unions do. Besides its ability to earn more interest, a high-yield savings account is structurally similar to a traditional savings account. It still has FDIC or NCUA insurance, and you need to pay attention to minimum opening requirements, minimum balance requirements for earning interest, and common bank fees. Higher Interest Rates Than Traditional Savings Accounts A traditional savings account from a brick-and-mortar financial institution typically pays a low interest rate. For example, big banks like Chase and Bank of America pay less than 0.05% APY on their standard savings account. You'll earn significantly more with a high-yield savings account. The highest savings rates land between 4% to 5% APY. Like other bank accounts, almost all high-yield savings accounts are either FDIC-insured or NCUA-insured, depending on whether you're banking with a bank or a credit union, respectively. This means your money will be ensured up to $250,000 for an individual bank account or up to $500,000 for ajoint bank account. High-yield savings accounts can be great for when you want to earn some money on your savings without risk and while still having easy access to it. This makes it ideal foremergency funds; you don't want to risk your emergency funds on investing, and you want to be able to access your emergency funds if something major happens. With high-yield savings accounts, you'll still be able to make money off your money without sacrificing safety and access. A savings account rate is variable, which means it can fluctuate after it is opened. Your bank will usually email you to tell you the rate will go up or down soon. Savings accounts may also have transfer limits, according to federal rule Regulation D. Generally, if a savings account has a transfer limit, this means that you'll only be permitted to make six transfers from the account each month. If you exceed the transfer limit, you will have to pay a fee for each additional transfer. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve has recentlyamended Regulation D, so banks may choose to suspend the monthly transfer limit so customers can make unlimited monthly transactions, or they could enforce a six-per-month limit. There are sixtypes of savings accounts: traditional savings accounts, high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, cash management accounts, and specialty savings accounts. The best savings account for you depends on your banking preferences, goals, and when you'll need to access your money. A high-yield savings account, for example, is a strong choice if you're comfortable with banking digitally and want to obtain a high interest rate. Depending on where you bank, some savings accounts may chargemonthly bank maintenance fees. A monthly service fee is an amount you'll have to pay each month to maintain an account. Some accounts will allow you to waive a monthly service fee if you meet certain requirements, while others cannot be waived. Bear in mind that some savings accounts do not charge certain fees at all. Some banks will require you to keep some money in your savings account to get the highest savings account interest rate. Savings account promotions are also more common in a competitive interest rate environment. You might see some companies pay a bonus rate for a new account for the first couple of months. These specials are to attract new customers. To make sure you're getting a top rate, find out what the interest rate will be once the promotion is over so you know there isn't a significant decline in APY. You should also factor in the overall customer experience at the bank. High-yield savings accounts are more commonly found at online banks. You might find some brick-and-mortar financial institutions with these accounts, or a few institutions that offer a hybrid experience, but for the most part, be prepared for a primarily digital banking experience. Somebanks offer 24/7 customer supportby phone or through live chat, so you may look into these options if traditional banking hours don't work well with your schedule. You can also check abank holiday scheduleto see if it has a flexible branch calendar. Some banks are open on holidays when other banks aren't, or they'll stay open for longer while other banks may close early before a holiday weekend. If you value strong mobile banking, you might prefer a bank with one of thebest mobile banking apps. It should also be noted that some smaller local institutions and new online banking divisions don't have mobile apps for their high-yield savings accounts. That could be a disadvantage because that's one less way to manage your account. Accessibility for cash deposits and withdrawals also varies widely between online banks. A handful ofhigh-yield savings accounts have debit cards or ATM cards, but for the most part, this isn't a common feature. Typically, you'll need to own a checking account with the same bank or make an external bank account transfer to take out cash. Depositing cash through a high-yield savings account can also involve extra steps, depending on the bank. Some banks do not let you make cash deposits on online high-yield savings accounts, so you have to deposit cash to the bank's checking account or to an external bank account from a different bank and then transfer money. A couple of online banks may have more ways for making cash deposits. For example, a few let you make cash deposits at ATMs in their network. You also might be able cash deposits at stores — usually there's a fee of around $5 per transaction, though. The interest rate isn't the only thing that matters in a high-yield savings account. When choosing an account, make sure you can afford the minimum deposit. You should also check whether there is a monthly service fee — and if so, find out if you qualify to waive it — or any requirements to earn the highest interest rate. It may also be helpful to look at what the requirements are for opening a savings account at a particular financial institution. Some banks allowimmigrants and non-U.S. citizens to open an accountwith a Matricula Consular or foreign passport instead of a U.S. ID. You can also open a second chance bank account, which doesn't use ChexSystems to review your banking history. These may be options to consider if you're struggling to open a bank account at a financial institution. Some institutions also limit the number of monthly withdrawals/transfers you can make from your high-yield savings account before charging you a fee. You want an account that will result in a high interest rate and few to no fees so you can earn as much as possible. You'll also want to consider accounts tailored to your specific circumstances; for example, if you're in the military, you might want a savings account from one of thebest military banks. Generally, you'll find the best nationwide savings interest rates at online banks. That said, a local credit union currently offers the highest interest rate on a savings account overall. You may get up to 10.00% APY on up to $1,000 in your savings if you join Community Financial Credit Union. Membership, however, is limited to people who live, work, attend school, or worship in Michigan, have an immediate family member who qualifies to join, or live in a household with a current member. You can also join through your company if it does regular business in Michigan. A good interest rate is one that pays above the average savings account interest rate. Theaverage savings accountin the United States offers 0.41% APY, but good accounts tend to pay between 3.70% to 5% APY. If you're more comfortable banking with a brick-and-mortar bank, a traditional savings account might be a better option for you. Just know that you may not be getting the best possible interest rate because online banks andcredit unionsusually offer higher rates. Once you're ready, you can apply for a high-yield savings account online. Typically, the bank will specify whether you can apply for individual and joint bank account, and if there are any age requirements to open a high-yield savings account. Some banks will only let you open a high-interest savings account if you're at least 18 years old. The application for opening a savings account requires basic information and proof of identity like your full name, home address, and job information. Online forms also generally require your Social Security number and driver's license information, although some banks let you use an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number instead of a Social Security number. You might also need to share copies of these documents if a bank asks for it. Some permit an alternative ID if you don't have a U.S. ID, like a foreign passport or Matricula Consular. Once you're approved to open an account, you'll be able to deposit money to a high-yield savings account. Some banks don't require an initial deposit, but if yours does, you can link an external bank account and make anACH transferas a funding method. If you choose an in-person bank, you might be able to deposit money at a branch as a funding method. If you'd like to have help opening a savings account, you can generally open a savings account at an in-person bank branch if your bank has it, or you can open an account over the phone. To maximize your earnings with a high-yield savings account, shop around to find one that pays a high rate and doesn't charge monthly service or excess withdrawal fees for taking money out regularly. You may find it helpful to set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your high-yield savings account. If you receive your paycheck as a direct deposit, you can also ask your employer to send a percentage of your paycheck to your high-yield savings account each pay period. As your balance grows with automatic savings and direct deposits, you'll earn more interest. If you're looking for ways onhow to save moneyand be more consistent with your habits, consider the following tips: A savings account's purpose is to give you a safe place to save money over time. If you're racking up bank fees or having a tough time managing your account, then your savings account isn't serving you. Write down the pros and cons of your current savings account, and explore other options to see if you can find a better fit. Another thing to keep in mind is that savings accounts aren't necessarily the best place to keep money for long-term financial goals. If you have a long-term goal and are comfortable taking on some risk, you can earn higher returns if youinvest in stocks. Once you have a savings account, don't forget that you'll need to report your interest as taxable income to the Internal Revenue Service when you're filing your tax return. You'll have to file a Form 1099-INT, which will ask you to report your interest earnings during the year. TheFederal Reserveis the central banking system of the U.S. It sets its own interest rates based on current economic conditions, taking into account things like inflation and employment. It meets several times a year, and when it meets, it announces whether it's decided to raise interest rates, lower interest rates, or keep interest rates the same. Whatever the Fed does, banks and credit unions usually follow suit. If the Fed lowers rates, you're likely to see lower savings account rates, but if it raises its rates, then you're likely to see higher savings rates too. Savings rates hit a historic high in 2023 following years of the Fed raising rates, topping out around 5.5% APY. In comparison, between 2014 and 2021, the highest the Fed ever set its rates was 2.5%. Historical savings rates follow similar patterns to historical Fed rates. The Federal Reserve maintained rates for a good part of 2024. Savings rates started lowering in anticipation of a rate cut, but for the most part, the highest savings account rates still clung to around 5% APY. In late 2024, the Federal Reserve lowered rates for the first time after closing in on rate of inflation and unemployment targets. The Fed lowered rates three times in 2024. Savings accounts, as a result, dropped more significantly, ranging just under 4% or 5% APY. At the first meeting of 2025, the Federal Reserve maintained interest rates. While rates are still high — Fed rates are currently targeted at 4.25% to 4.50% — we're likely to continue seeing interest rate decline in the coming years. This means savings rates will continue to trend downward. Interest rates on high-interest savings accounts closely follow the federal funds rate. This means rates are variable and can change several times per year at the whim of the Federal Reserve. Keeping track of when thenext Fed meetingwill happen and whether rates can change can help you better understand fluctuations in high-yield savings account rates. If the interest rate on your savings account drops significantly, you may decide to look at other financial institutions to see if you can find a more competitive interest rate elsewhere. Typically, online banks and credit unions offer the highest interest rates for savings accounts. However, bear in mind that changing accounts may not be worth the effort, particularly if your new account's rate drops afterward. You also might consider other types of savings account options. For example, buying savings bonds or comparingCDs vs high-yield savings accountsmay be worth doing if you've already established your emergency fund. Thebest CD ratesare comparable to the best high-yield savings account rates. You might prefer a CD if you want to lock in a high rate for a set period of time, since CDs offer fixed rates. You won't risk your rate decreasing as you would with a savings account. But CDs offer less flexibility. You can't put more money into a CD after the initial opening deposit, and you'll pay a penalty if you take out money before the term ends. So, if you open a3-year CD, you won't be able to take your money out of the CD until three years have passed without paying early withdrawal penalties. That being said, something like aCD ladder, which is where you buy multiple CDs with different term lengths, could give you more liquidity while still letting you lock in good rates. If you're trying to decide between CDs versus high-yield savings accounts, your choice could come down to when you need to deposit and/or withdraw money. (We also have a full explanation of howno-penalty CDs compare to savings accounts.) Money market accountsare similar to high-yield savings accounts, but they typically make it easier to access your savings. The best money market accounts come with features checking accounts might have, such as an ATM card, debit card, or paper checks. Thebest high-yield checking accountsare great tools for earning even more interest on your money. But checking account balances are often lower than savings account balances because you use them to spend money. If you're serious about using interest to grow your balance, a high-yield savings account is usually the better bet. The current top high-yield savings account rate is from the Community Financial Credit Union High Yield Savings Account, which offers up to 10.00%. You'll need to live in Michigan to open an account, though. Yes, thesavings rate forecast for 2025indicates rates are expected to decline throughout the year. Savings account rates peaked, and as market conditions change, it's expected that banks will steadily lower rates in response to Fed rate cuts. It's safe to keep all of your money in a high-yield savings account if your balance is $250,000 or less (for an individual account) or $500,000 or less (in a joint account). The FDIC and NCUA insure up to $250,000 per owner, per category. Soif your bank fails, all of your insured money would be safe. If you have more than the FDIC or NCUA would insure, consider opening a second account at another institution or choosing a bank that offers enhanced FDIC insurance coverage. Yes, high-yield savings accounts are still great places to store your extra money or emergency funds. With high-yield savings accounts you're making money on your savings with low risk and easy access. Some fees associated with high-yield savings accounts include monthly maintenance fees, excess transaction fees, paper statement fees, and inactivity fees. Some banks let you easily access money in your high-yield savings account because they have physical locations or offer multiple ways to make deposits or withdrawals. Others might not offer many ways to access your money, so you'll have to rely a lot on transferring money to external bank accounts, which can be tedious. We consulted banking and financial planning experts to inform these picks and provide their advice on finding the best high-yield savings accounts for your needs. Here's what our expert panel had to say about high-interest savings accounts. (Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.) Generally, what makes a high-yield savings account good or not good? Roger Ma, CFP® professional with and author of""Work Your Money, Not Your Life"": ""It might not be as seamless to get your money out of an online savings account as it is a brick-and-mortar, but you don't want to have so much friction where it's such a pain to get the money out when you need it."" Mykail James, MBA, certified financial education instructor,BoujieBudgets.com: ""Anything with a fee is not a good high-yield savings account. Anything that restricts how much you can save is, to me, not very good. If I can't save more than $10,000 in this account, and then I have to move it over somewhere else — to me, that's not a really good savings account, because it's not really prepared to help me expand and grow, which is what a savings account is supposed to do. I also look at interest rates, definitely. I look to see when the interest is paid. Is it quarterly, or is it monthly? How often do they pay out interest, and what are the interest rate stipulations?"" Sophia Acevedo, banking editor, Business Insider: ""I would consider looking for features that will help manage your account. Some banks have high-yield savings accounts that let you separate your savings into individual goals and track your progress. Other financial institutions will let you deposit cash at ATMs or some retailers. A good high-yield savings account will likely be an account where you can grow your savings without unnecessary hassles."" How should someone decide whether to put their money in a high-yield savings account, money market account, or CD? Tania Brown, CFP® professional, vice president of coaching strategy atOfColor: ""So I guess we'll start off with how much money you want to put in and the level of transactions you want to have. If you want to have any transactions, that automatically takes out CDs. Then you're stuck between the high-yield savings and the money market account."" Sophia Acevedo, Business Insider: ""I would create a list of what I prioritize most in a bank account. For example, some banks have accounts that charge monthly service fees. I would look to see what the requirements are for waiving the monthly service fee and whether I think I could feasibly meet those requirements each month. If I'm searching for an interest-earning bank account, I'll pay attention to interest rates. I would make sure the account pays a higher interest rate than the average bank account."" There are many high-yield savings accounts available across financial institutions. Through our research, we've found that the best high-yield savings accounts are offered by banks with a strong online presence, robo-advisors, and other internet-only financial companies. If you're more comfortable banking with a national brick-and-mortar bank, you'll likely have to consider a premium savings account to earn a more competitive interest rate.

You can learn more about how we review products through oureditorial standards page. We have reviewed around 230 savings accounts to identify the strongest options. While interest rates (specifically, APY) are an important aspect of any savings account, we also consider minimum deposits, monthly service fees, customer support availability, mobile app ratings, ethics, security, and miscellaneous features. We use a weighted average to get our star rating, which means we weigh certain features, like interest rates and fees, at a higher weight percentage than others. We understand that these areas can more heavily impact a person's overall banking experience. We rate bank products on a scale from one to five stars, with one star being the lowest rating, three stars being an in-between rating, and five stars being the highest rating possible.

Raisin Review,"Raisin is a great option if your ultimate goal is to earn thebest savings account, money market account, and CD rates out there. Raisin offers APYs of up to 4.39% on savings and up to 4.37% on CDs.  It's a marketplace that connects you with accounts you might not be able to access otherwise, including ones at community-driven and minority-owned institutions. You'll also earn higher rates than if you opened an account directly through one of its partner banks. Raisin is a digital marketplace for finding high-yield accounts. It partners with banks and credit unions to offer you special interest rates if you open an account through Raisin rather than directly on the partner banks' websites. Raisin has been providing a similar high-yield savings account marketplace in Europe. It works with over 400 banks and has more than 1 million direct customers. It started providing services in the U.S. through SaveBetter, and SaveBetter has now officially rebranded as Raisin. Raisin is not a good choice if you want immediate access to your savings, though — it doesn't offer checking accounts, so you'll need to keep a checking account at another institution and make transfers between banks, which could take up to a few business days. One of the primary benefits of using Raisin is that you'll be able to find a variety of savings accounts, money market accounts, and CDs with high interest rates. Many of these rates are exclusive options, and the rates are higher than what you would find if you opened an account directly from a participating bank's website. Raisin also stands out for its opening requirements. There's a $1 minimum opening deposit and no monthly service fee for all accounts. At traditional financial institutions, you may need to be mindful ofmonthly bank maintenance feesor higher minimum opening requirements. Raisin offers severaltypes of savings accounts, but it doesn't offer any checking or business bank accounts. As a result, if you transfer money to an external account, it may take one to three business days to process. Because you're not directly banking with a financial institution, there are also a couple of unique downsides. For example, Raisin doesn't let you receive direct deposits or make cash deposits. You also can't connect your selected savings accounts to a third-party budgeting app like Rocket Money orYNAB App. Raisin also has poor mobile app ratings on both the Apple Store and Google Play Store. That said, there are fewer than 60 reviews on each mobile app. Raisin partners with multiple banks and credit unions, includingSallie Mae, SkyOne Federal Credit Union, and more. Raisin can change partner companies at any time. Many of the institutions are less well-known companies — but the good news is that your money is still safe with these less popular brands. You haveFDICinsurance for banks (orNCUA insurancewith credit unions) when you open accounts through Raisin. This means up to $250,000 is safe in an individual account, and $500,000 in a joint account. Credit unions require you to become a member to open an account, and membership is usually only available to employees of certain companies or residents of specific counties. But when you open a credit union account through Raisin, you simply have to sign a membership agreement, and you'll qualify without having to pay any membership fees. Some of the partner bank accounts are available nationwide, but you'll earn a higher rate through Raisin. Others are usually only available in certain areas, but they're available around the U.S. through Raisin. The marketplace gives you the chance to earn high interest rates with the added bonus of working with institutions whose values you support. For example, Ponce Bank is certified as a community development financial institution (CDFI), meaning it serves a local disadvantaged community. It's also aHispanic-American owned bank. When you're searching for accounts, Raisin lets you filter by the type of institution you want, such as minority-led, family-owned, or one with a local focus. Once you deposit money into your account through Raisin, it's held in an omnibus custodial account at the partner bank. The custodial account is managed byLewis & Clark Bank, which is the custodian bank. When your funds are in a custodial account, the money is pooled with deposits from other Raisin customers. Custodial accounts make it possible for Raisin to deposit money to separate banks, but they do come with drawbacks. The main downside is that it's a little difficult to access your savings. To deposit or withdraw money, you must link your Raisin account to an external account, then transfer money between the accounts. These transfers typically take one to three business days. So you'd always want to keep a checking account at a separate bank for these transfers. To contact customer service, call Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. ET. You can also send an email or use automated chat on the website. Some Redditor users have said they've experienced long wait times to receive customer support, though. Traditional banks and credit unions may offer more customer service availability. Somebanks have 24/7 customer supportthrough online chat or telephone. Raisin is rated 2.0 out of 5 stars in the Apple store, and 3.1 out of 5 stars in the Google Play store. However, there are fewer than 60 reviews on each mobile app. The Better Business Bureau grades companies based on responses to customer complaints, transparency about business practices, government actions against the businesses, and more. The BBB gives Raisin anA+ gradebecause there are several complaints against the company on the BBB website. Raisin does not have any public controversies. It can be good to read customer reviews or talk with friends and family who have used Raisin to get a better idea of what your experience could be like. You also may want to look into the BBB grade and customer reviews for a partner bank you're considering using through Raisin. Right now, you can get a $250savings account bonusfrom Raisin as a new customer. You can qualify for the bonus if you open a new, eligible account with Raisin using the code GET250 and deposit money into the account for the first time between March 3 and March 31. You'll earn the $250 if you deposit at least $25,000 into the account within 14 days of your first deposit and maintain a $25,000 balance over the next 90 days. Once you meet those requirements, the bonus will be deposited into your external linked bank account within 30 days. Eligible accounts include high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts, high-yield CDs, and no-penalty CDs. Theaverage savings account interest ratenationwide is just 0.41% APY. Many savings accounts at national banks charge monthly fees if you don't qualify to waive them. You'll earn significantly more through Raisin's partner savings and money market accounts, and you won't pay monthly fees. Let's say you leave $10,000 in a savings account untouched. At a traditional bank that pays 0.05% APY compounded daily, you'd earn $5 in one year (which might be cancelled out by how much you pay in monthly fees). Maybe you open an account with Raisin that pays 5.00% APY. In one year, you'd earn $512.67 on that $10,000. Savings andmoney market accountshave variable interest rates, so rates can fluctuate at any time. But CDs have fixed rates, meaning that if you open a 1-year CD with a 5% APY, that rate is set in stone and you'll earn 5% for the entire year. There are other benefits to opening a fixed-rate CD through Raisin besides a higher rate. First, you may have access to a term length (say two months or nine months) that isn't available directly through the bank. Second, you only need $1 to open a CD through Raisin, regardless of which partner bank you choose. CDs typically require hundreds or even thousands to open an account. For example, you would normally need $2,500 to open a CD with Sallie Mae, but you only need $1 to open a Sallie Mae CD with Raisin. Keep in mind that you will have to pay anearly withdrawal penaltyif you take out money before the term ends. When searching for fixed-rate CDs on the Raisin website, click on ""product terms"" next to the CD you're considering to see what that fee would be. Unlike regular CDs,no-penalty CDsdo not charge you for taking out money before a term ends. Most banks require you to take out all the money in one lump sum, though. No-penalty CDs aren't super common, so it's nice that Raisin gives you even more options than you may find elsewhere. If you're searching for the highest savings rates, Raisin will likely stand out more than Ally. Raisin has savings accounts, money market accounts, and CDs from a variety of banks and credit unions that pay more than any of Ally's bank accounts. Although Raisin has partnerships with many banks, your overall banking options and services are still limited. Raisin doesn't offer checking accounts or access to other types of products like credit cards or loans. If you're looking to do all your banking with one financial institution, Ally is a great option. Ally is one of thebest online banks, and it has minimal fees and easy opening requirements for a variety of products. Ally is also faster and makes it easier to access your money. You can simply transfer money between the bank's checking and savings accounts and see the change almost instantly. Raisin and the online bank Popular Direct both offer some of thebest CD ratesand savings account rates overall, so deciding between the two companies may ultimately depend on the account you want and how much you plan to deposit upfront. Raisin may be a better choice if are looking for accounts with low minimum opening requirements – you only need $1 to get started. Meanwhile, Popular Direct has pretty steep opening requirements for an online bank. You'll need $100 to open a savings account and $10,000 to open a CD. Popular Direct offers a checking account though, which Raisin doesn't offer. Hence, you may prefer Popular Direct if you want more direct access to your savings. Popular Direct also allows direct deposits, while Raisin does not. At Personal Finance Insider, we rate products on a scale from one to five stars. We use abank account rating methodologythat compares and contrasts the features and fine print of various products to help determine if the account may be right for you. Our Raisin savings and money market accounts have the same star rating whereas Raisin CDs have a slightly different rating because they have a fixed interest rate as well as other features. Our general Raisin rating is an average rating of our individual product ratings, plus the platform's overall trustworthiness. For example, we'll look at the minimum opening deposit, interest rate,  monthly service fees, customer support availability, mobile app ratings, and ethics of a company to determine the rate for a savings account. For CDs, we'll look at similar criteria. However, we'll factor in early withdrawal penalties and CD variety, and we won't consider monthly service fees since that isn't applicable. We use a weighted average to get our star rating, which means we weigh certain features, like interest rates and fees, at a higher weight percentage than others. We understand that these areas can more heavily impact a person's overall banking experience. Yes, Raisin is a legitimate company. It connects you to bank accounts that are federally insured by the FDIC or NCUA. Yes, Raisin is a trustworthy service overall. Raisin isn't a bank, it's an online marketplace that connects you with partner banks. Through these partner banks, your money is federally insured by the FDIC or NCUA. The American Institute of CPAs has given Raisin an SOC 2 certification, which means the AICPA has audited Raisin and found that the company has a high level of online security. No, Raisin doesn't charge a membership fee or a monthly bank maintenance fee. You'll only pay a fee if you withdraw money from a CD before the term ends — this is known as an early withdrawal penalty. Yes, accounts you open through Raisin are insured. Accounts at partner banks are federally insured by the FDIC, and ones at partner credit unions are insured by the NCUA. Raisin is owned by Raisin GmbH, a logistics firm founded in 2012. Raisin GmbH is based in Berlin, Germany, and owns both Raisin and Raisin UK. To withdraw money from Raisin, transfer funds from your Raisin-affiliated account to an external bank account. The transfer will probably take one to three business days.",https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/raisin-review
Best Checking Accounts,"Checking accounts are optimal tools for everyday expenses and transactions. If you're more interested in saving money, you should explore thebest high-yield savings accounts, instead. There are many differenttypes of checking accountsout there, and finding the right one may help you manage your money more efficiently. Compare checking accounts that offer high APYs, rewards on debit card purchases, or both. APYs (Annual Percentage Yields) are accurate as of 03/13/2025. Business Insider's personal finance team reviewed over 200 checking accounts to find thebest banksand credit unions that offered them. To help you find a checking account based on your preferences, we narrowed down our top picks by creating multiple categories, so you know why a particular account stands out.

This account also stands out as one of thebest banks for avoiding overdraft fees. For example, one overdraft service offered is free savings transfers. To utilize the service, you'll link your checking account to a savings account. If you overdraw, Capital One will cover your overdraft by transferring money from your savings account automatically. There's no fee involved for this service, which is an added bonus because typically financial institutions charge a fee. Something to keep in mind with Capital One is that it has Capital One Cafes in select areas throughout the U.S. At Capital One Cafes, you can get bank services through a Cafe Ambassador.

If you want to knowhow to open a checking account, here are a few steps to follow: Online checking accounts are managed primarily through online and mobile banking. In comparison, traditional checking accounts are available at brick-and-mortar banks. You can visit local branches to conduct everyday transactions and speak to a banker. Most of our top picks are online checking accounts because they charge minimal bank fees. Traditional checking accounts often have minimum balance requirements to waive a monthly service fee or earn interest. There are other online checking account benefits that make these accounts strong options overall, including high interest rates and cash-back perks. There are five types of checking accounts: regular checking accounts, high-interest checking accounts, cash-back checking accounts, and specialty checking accounts. Here's an overview of each type of checking account: The best checking account for you may hinge on your banking preferences and goals. For example, if you regularly maintain a high checking account balance, the best high-yield checking accounts may be appealing options. The best checking accounts are no-fee checking account options. They have minimal bank fees, like monthly service,overdraft fees, and out-of-network ATMs. The most suitable option for you might also depend on whether you're looking for special perks, like a cash bonus, interest, or cash-back rewards.

Generally, local financial institutions have the smallest ATM networks, followed by regional banks. National banks usually offer their own ATM network or are partnered with a national network like Allpoint. Yes, many banks have interest-earning checking accounts. You might need to maintain a certain account balance or make frequent debit card transactions to earn interest. If you're unhappy with your current checking account, compare other banks and see if another is more suitable. Switching banks may be the best option if you aren't satisfied with your overall banking experience. We consulted banking and financial planning experts to inform these picks and provide their advice on finding the best checking accounts for your needs. Here's what they had to say about checking accounts. (Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.) What are some good qualities to look for in a checking account? Roger Ma, CFP® professional and author of""Work Your Money, Not Your Life"": ""I would look at the ATM branch locations and then minimum balance amounts to not incur a monthly fee … I think there's other stuff that could make life easier, whether it's free checks, online bill pay, are they in the Zelle network?"" Sophia Acevedo, banking editor,Business Insider: ""I would look for a checking account that either doesn't have any monthly service fees or offers multiple ways to waive the fee. I would also look at customer support availability and mobile app ratings."" How can someone find the right bank? Tania Brown, CFP® professional and vice president of coaching strategy atOfColor: ""Obviously, you want to make sure it's FDIC insured. Also, your banking experience — do you like walking into a bank? Well, then you need someone local. Do you just not care if you ever see your bank? Then you're okay online. Do you write checks? Do you not write checks? So it's thinking through how your experience with it is going to be before you make that decision."" Mykail James, MBA, certified financial education instructor,BoujieBudgets.com: ""The No. 1 thing about a checking account is you should know what provider the debit card is coming from. And a lot of people don't think about that, because there are places that don't accept MasterCard or don't accept Amex."" At Business Insider, we strive to help smart people make the best decisions with their money. We spent hours comparing and contrasting the features and fine print of 200 checking accounts, so you don't have to. Business Insider's personal finance team is editorially independent, which means our business team does not decide how we cover products and what we write about. Read more about how we rate and review products on oureditorial standards page. We understand that ""best"" is often subjective, however, so in addition to highlighting the clear benefits of a checking account — no fees, for example — we outline the limitations, too. We considered 200 checking account offerings using ourbank account methodologyto determine the strongest options for the best checking accounts. We gave precedence to no-monthly-fee checking accounts or those with the option to waive monthly fees with qualifying activities, overdraft protection options, widespread ATM access and/or reimbursement for ATM fees, and mobile banking capabilities. We rate bank products on a scale from one to five stars. If a checking account has a rating of one star, that's the lowest possible, and it means the bank account requires significant improvement. If a checking account has five stars, that's the highest rating possible, and it's considered a superior option. For checking accounts, we look at minimum opening deposit requirements, monthly service fees, overdraft protection options, ATM network/fees, customer support availability, mobile app ratings, miscellaneous features and overall ethics and security of the company. We score each of these features on a scale of zero to five, then calculate the weighted average to get an account's final rating.

For example, if you have $100 in your secured account, you'll have a $100 credit limit; you don't have a set credit limit when you open your card. That being said, you have a daily credit limit of $10,000, no matter how much is in your account. Chime offers a fee-free tax return service for its members through April Tax Solutions and Column Tax. Chime's website says that its freetax softwaredoesn't charge any fees for filing both state and federal taxes, although the website's fine print mentions that you might have to pay if you decide to buy other optional financial products offered in relation to your tax filing. If the tax return software makes a mistake that results in you having to pay money to the IRS that you wouldn't have to otherwise, Chime's tax software partners will reimburse you up to a total of $10,000. If you find an error in the preparation that lowers your total refund, april will let you amend your return for no additional charge. Column Tax will reimburse you for up to $250 if you are able to get a higher federal or state tax return or lower refund elsewhere. If you choose todirect deposityour tax return into your Chime account, you could get your return up to six days early. Chime's website says it covers the most common tax situations, including salary and self-employed income, freelance and gig work income, unemployment income, crypto or stock sales, and itemizedtax deductions. Chime has aB- ratingfrom the Better Business Bureau. The BBB grades a company based on its honesty in its advertising, transparency about business operations, and responsiveness to customer complaints. The highest possible grade is an A+. Chime has this rating to the high number of customer complaints on the BBB website, as well as the government action taken against the business. In 2024, theCFPB required Chime to pay a $3.25 million penalty. The CFPB says that Chime did not give customers timely refunds when their accounts were closed, which caused significant financial harm to consumers. The CFPB also required that Chime provide at least $1.3 million to the consumers it harmed. Many users havefiled complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, saying that Chime has unexpectedly closed their accounts and sometimes kept them from accessing their money. Ally is an online bank that offers CDs and a money market account — so if you want to open either of these account types, it's the clear option. Chime only has checking and savings accounts.Ally savings ratesare also much higher than Chime savings rates. Chime is the better option if you need to deposit cash into your account because you can deposit cash at select retailers (some retailers charge a fee). Ally allows you to deposit checks digitally, but not cash. Chime is also the better option if you have poor credit or banking history because it will accept your application and help you increase your credit score. Capital One 360 is anonline bankthat offers checking, savings, and CD accounts. It's the obvious choice if you want a CD, since Chime doesn't offer CDs. It's also the better option if you want to open a savings account but not a checking account, as Chime requires you to have a checking account to qualify for savings. Capital One also offers a high-yield savings account with a significantly better rate than what Chime pays. This account gives it a major edge over Chime. Both institutions are great forsecond chance bank accountsbecause they don't check your banking history before approving your application. Chime's banking options are low on fees, making them a good choice if you don't want to worry aboutmonthly bank maintenance fees. Chime's savings account, checking account, and credit card all have zero monthly service fees. If you get a Chime checking account, you'll need to pay a $2.50 out-of-network ATM fee if you use an ATM that isn't in Chime's network. You'll also probably have to pay a third-party fee charged by the out-of-network ATM. Thebest banks to avoid ATM feesboth don't charge out-of-network ATM fees and reimburse third-party ATM fees. Chime has good bank products, but it isn't a bank itself. That being said, Chime is still legit, and its banking products are still covered by the FDIC. Despite not being a bank, Chime is a legitimate banking service. Chime is a financial technology company, not a bank, but it partners with two banks to provide and back its bank accounts: Stride Bank and The Bancorp Bank. Your money is actually being held in bank accounts offered by those two banks, which means the money in your checking account and savings account are FDIC-insured for up to $250,000. To review Chime, we used thePersonal Finance Insider bank account methodology. Each account receives a rating between one and five stars. We look at ethics, security, miscellaneous features, customer service, and the mobile app when rating each bank account. Other factors considered depend on which type of account we're reviewing. For example, we evaluate interest rates for savings accounts and overdraft fees for checking accounts. We use a weighted average to get our star rating, which means we weigh certain features, like interest rates and fees, at a higher weight percentage than others. We understand that these areas can more heavily impact a person's overall banking experience. Yes, Chime has legit checking and savings accounts. Its partner banks are Stride Bank, N.A. and The Bancorp Bank, which provide FDIC insurance on up to $250,000 in your Chime accounts. Some of Chime's main downsides are that it doesn't have joint accounts, and it pays a lower savings rate than many other onlinehigh-yield savings accounts. Chime may be worth it if you're looking for a strong checking account — theChime® Checking Accountdoesn't charge monthly service, overdraft, or foreign transaction fees. It's also worth it if you have a poor credit or banking history. It doesn't check your credit score or banking history when you apply for an account, and it has several tools to help you boost your credit score. Chime has a fee-free overdraft protection program called SpotMe®. This program allows you to overdraw by up to $20, and your limit may go up to $200, depending on your Chime account history. SpotMe® has its pros and cons. You don't have to link to a savings account for overdraft protection like you do with many banks. But you can only qualify for SpotMe® if you receive at least $200 in direct deposits per month. You may withdraw up to $500 per day from an ATM with Chime. You can also make a total of $2,500 in debit card purchases per day. Chime offers some good banking services, but Chime is not a bank. Chime is a financial technology company that offers banking services by partnering with Stride Bank and The Bancorp Bank. Chime® Disclosures:Chime is a financial technology company, not a bank.

SoFi Checking and Saving,"Business Insider's personal finance team comparedSoFi® Checking and Savings (Member FDIC)to thebest checking accountsand savings accounts, and found it to be an industry leader. SoFi® is a great account option if you don't mind keeping your savings and checking in one account. You can earn a competitive interest rate if you set up direct deposit or deposit a minimum of $5,000 per month. You can also earn a cash bonus of up to $300 if you are a new customer and set up direct deposits, or as an existing customer that hasn't set up direct deposits yet. Earn up to a $300 bonus with qualifying direct deposits for eligible customers through 1/31/2026. Earn up to 3.80% APY on savings balances (including Vaults) with direct deposit or qualifying deposit. Access to additional insurance up to $3M on deposits through a seamless network of participating banks. SoFi Checking and Savings is a great account option if you don't mind keeping your savings and checking in one account. SoFi® Checking and Savings (Member FDIC): up to 3.80% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) SoFi® offers different interest rates for checking and savings balances. You can get high-yield savings with SoFi, earning up to 3.80% APY if you set up a direct deposit of any amount or deposit at least $5,000 every 30 days. If you don't set up a direct deposit or receive a monthly qualifying deposit, you'll only earn up to 1.00% APY on savings balances. SoFi checking balances pay 0.50% APY. The APY is the same for all customers. SoFi® is an online institution that offersloans,investment accounts, and banking options. SoFi doesn't have physical locations so you'll have to open and manage your bank account online. When you apply for a SoFi banking account online, you cannot apply for either the checking or savings account on their own — you'll have to get both, hence it's name SoFi® Checking and Savings (Member FDIC). You can get your paycheck up to two days early through the online bank. To get this perk, you must receive a qualifying direct deposit. SoFi® defines a qualifyingdirect depositas a paycheck from an employer (including pension plans), payroll provider, benefits provider, or government entity (this includes Social Security payments). If you're a new customer or existing customer who hasn't set up direct deposits yet, you could also get abank account bonusof up to $300. To qualify for the cash bonus, all you need to do is receive at least one qualifying direct deposit, the first of which must be received on or after December 7, 2023. You'll earn a $50 cash bonus if you receive direct deposits between $1,000 and $4,999.99, or a bonus of $300 if you receive direct deposits of $5,000 or more within 25 days. The bonus will be deposited into the account around seven business days after the 25-day period. SoFi®'s Money Vaults feature makes it asavings account with buckets. Money Vaults are a savings tool to help you contribute money toward a savings goal. Money Vaults are part ofSoFi® Checking and Savings (Member FDIC); they're not separate accounts. You can make up to 20 at once. Money Vaults earn the same APY as savings account balances. Hence, your rate will be up to 3.80% APY when you receive a monthly direct deposit of $5,000 or more every 30 days. If you don't set up direct deposits or receive a qualifying amount every 30 days, you'll earn up to 1.00% APY. SoFi® has no-feeoverdraft protectionthat covers negative balances up to $50. To be eligible for SoFi Overdraft Coverage, you must get at least $1,000 in direct deposits. You'll get a notification once you qualify for overdraft protection. Keep in mind SoFi overdraft protection only applies to negative balances resulting from debit card purchases. You won't be able to use overdraft protection for ATM withdrawals,ACH transfers, or transactions using online bill pay. If you are worried about overdrawing from your account, you may prefer one of thebest banks for overdrafts. Other online banks have multiple overdraft protection plans or cover higher overdraft balances. The account comes with some tools designed to help you save money. For example, you can set up its AutoSave feature to automatically take a percentage or a specific dollar amount out of your paychecks and put it into your savings account or a specific Vault. This can help you planhow to budgetand then automate that budgeting process. SoFi also offers a Roundups feature to help you make progress on yoursavings goals. If you opt-in to Roundups, every purchase you make with the SoFi debit card will be rounded up to the nearest dollar amount and transferred to your savings account or preferred Vault. These small savings can add up over time, saving you money in the long run. You can turn on Roundups in SoFi'smobile banking appby selecting the Vault you want to send the money to, choosing ""Add New,"" then selecting ""Roundups"" and using the toggle to turn the feature on. You can also turn it on the same way from the Autopilot menu on your SoFi app's homepage. SoFi®'s online and mobile banking lets you see the banking, investing, and loan products in one place.

TheSoFi® Checking and Savings (Member FDIC)account is offered through SoFi Bank, National Association (N.A.). In 2022, the Office of theComptroller of Current conditionally approved SoFi's applicationto establish SoFi Bank, N.A. as a full-service bank. As part of the conditional authorization, SoFi Bank N.A. acquired Golden Pacific Bank, N.A., an FDIC-insured bank with three branches in Northern California. SoFi® members will be able to protect up to $3 million in deposits through the SoFi Insured Deposit Program. Money beyond the traditionalFDICinsurance limit will be put into FDIC-insured accounts at partner banks. The Better Business Bureau rates companies to see if they handle business practices well, have honest advertising, and respond effectively to customer complaints. The BBB gives SoFi anA+ rating. Opening an account with SoFi® automatically makes you a SoFi member. SoFi members get access to several different perks, one of which is SoFi Member Rewards. With SoFi Rewards, you earn reward points that you can convert to cash or credits that go toward one of your SoFi accounts, or that you can use to book travel. How you earn those points is different, though. Once you've enrolled in SoFi Member Rewards in your SoFi app, you can earn SoFi Rewards points in a number of ways, including by linking your first external account to the SoFi Relay tool, signing up forcredit score monitoring, activating your SoFi debit card, or by setting up BillPay.

This discount only applies to your first purchase of a Will or Trust-based estate plan. One of the main benefits ofSoFi® Checking and Savings (Member FDIC)is that it has minimal bank fees. You won't worry aboutmonthly bank maintenance feesor overdraft fees. If you've set up direct deposits of at least $1,000, you'll be eligible for SoFi overdraft protection, covering negative balances up to $50. SoFi doesn't charge you for point-of-sale transactions or Allpoint ATM transactions. However, if the out-of-network provider charges you a fee, SoFi doesn't offer reimbursements. In comparison, thebest banks for avoiding ATM feesoffer domestic or international ATM fee reimbursements for out-of-network providers. We compared SoFi's account to two popular online banks with separate checking and savings accounts:Chime®and Ally. SoFi® has a hybrid savings/checking account, so it could be more appealing than Ally if you are looking for an all-in-one account. Ally may be more suitable than SoFi if you want a variety of bank account options — it offers CDs and a money market account, which SoFi doesn't have. SoFi® offers a higher interest rate on savings balances than Ally if you set up direct deposit or deposit minimum $5,000 per month. Ally may be a better option if you don't want to set up a direct deposit, though. TheAlly Savings Accountpays a flat interest rate of 3.70% Annual Percentage Yield (APY), while SoFi members only earn up to 1.00% APY on savings balances when they don't have qualifying activities. Ally is also a better choice if you don't want to deal with out-of-networkbank ATM fees. The bank doesn't charge a fee for using an out-of-network ATM, and you'll get up to $10 per month in reimbursements if an ATM charges you a fee. Meanwhile, SoFi won't reimburse out-of-network ATM charges. Chime offers a checking and savings account. Both SoFi® and Chime charge zero monthly service fees and require no minimum opening deposit, which is great if you're looking for accounts with lenient opening requirements. SoFi® currently pays a higher interest rate on savings balances than Chime if you have qualifying activities; Chime offers an interest rate of 2.00% APY. If you do not want to set up a direct deposit or add qualifying deposits, then Chime may be more appealing. However, you would need to openChime® Checking Accountbefore opening theChime Savings Account. You must open theSoFi® Checking and Savings (Member FDIC)account online; SoFi is an online-only bank. You must be at least 18 years old and use a Social Security number to open the account. The online application also requires you to fill in basic information about yourself, like your full name, address, citizenship status, and email. If you are a U.S. resident or non-permanent resident, you'll include your country of citizenship. To add money to the account, you may set up direct deposits, deposit checks, link an external bank account, or make cash deposits through a participating retailer. SoFi doesn't have physical branches if you want to withdraw money, but you can take out money at an Allpoint ATM. SoFi® is an excellent choice if you don't want to deal withcommon bank fees. It's a no-account-fee checking and savings account option. The account offers a couple of unique perks. There's a savings tool called Money Vaults, which helps you save for individual goals. You can earn a competitive interest rate that's higher than what many traditional and high-yield savings accounts pay if you set up direct deposit or have qualifying deposits of $5,000 or more per month. Even if you don't have qualifying deposits, you'll still earn a great interest rate. You also might like this account if you're looking to get a cash bonus — new customers or existing customers who haven't set up direct deposits yet are eligible for a cash bonus of up to $300. At Business Insider, we rate bank accounts on a scale from one to five stars. For ourSoFi® Checking and Savings (Member FDIC)review, we combined ourbank account methodologiesfor savings and checking accounts by looking at the minimum opening deposit, interest rate, monthly service fee, overdraft protection option, ATM network/fees, customer support availability, mobile app ratings, miscellaneous features, and ethics and security of the company.

To help you get a better understanding of the overall ethics of a company, we include Better Business Bureau ratings and recent settlement history of the last three years. The BBB measures businesses by looking at responses to customer complaints, honesty in advertising, and transparency about business practices. Vio Bank is a division of MidFirst Bank, so we included the BBB rating for MidFirst Bank. Since thePonce Bank Money Market Deposit Accountis available through Raisin, we included Raisin's BBB rating. Here are the BBB scores for the other institutions on our list: TotalBank has anA- ratingfrom the BBB because it hasn't responded to a complaint filed against it. Brilliant Bank is an online-only division of Equity Bank. Brilliant Bank hasn't been rated by the BBB yet, but Equity Bank has received aB- gradefrom the BBB because its failed to respond to two compliants. Redneck Bank and its parent company, All America Bank, have anNR (No Rating)from the BBB because the bureau doesn't have enough information to rate either company yet. CFG Bank currentlydoesn't have a ratingbecause its profile is being updated on the BBB website. MYSB Direct doesn't have a BBB page, but its parent bank, M.Y.Safra Bank, does. M.Y.Safra was still given anNR ratingfrom the BBB because the BBB does not have enough information about the business, though. A strong BBB rating does not guarantee that you'll have a smooth relationship with a company, though. You still may want to ask friends and family about their experiences to see if a bank is right for you. A money market account is atype of savings accountthat you can find at many financial institutions. Features can vary by bank, but usually, these accounts offer a tiered interest rate and let you access your account through check-writing privileges or a debit or ATM card. Money market accounts let you grow your savings securely andearn interest. The amount of interest you'll earn on a money market account is shown through the annual percentage yield (APY). APY is a percentage, and it tells you how much you'll earn over the course of a year. Government agencies like the FDIC or NCUA protect certain money in bank accounts so that even if there's a bank failure, your money will be protected. Up to $250,000 per depositor, per ownership category is safe in a money market account. This means if you open a money market account by yourself, up to $250,000 is insured. Meanwhile, if you open a joint bank account with someone else, up to $500,000 can be insured in an account. These accounts also often offer more accessibility than traditional savings accounts or CDs — many banks offer a debit card or paper checks along with the account. If your money market comes with a debit card or ATM card, make sure you know how big its ATM network is and what fees it charges for out-of-network ATM usage. According to the FDIC, theaverage money market accountpays 0.64% APY. However, the best online banks offer money market accounts with significantly higher interest rates. Some banks will require you to meet certain criteria to earn interest. You might also see a money market account with tiered interest rates, which means the rate you earn depends on the amount of money you keep in the account. To maximize your interest earnings, carefully review the bank's interest requirements to ensure you qualify for the highest rate. Also, the compounding frequency for your money market account can affect your total interest earnings if you maintain a high balance. Banks may pay compound interest daily, monthly, quarterly, or annually. APY includes compounding frequency. A strong money market account won't have any monthly service fees,overdraft fees, or out-of-network ATM fees. Some banks will also reimburse you if you're charged by an out-of-network provider. Banks specifycommon bank feesassociated with a money market account in a fee schedule. You can find this information online, or you can call customer service to request fee information. Money market accounts areFDIC-insured at banks or NCUA-insured at credit unions. In the event of a bank failure, these government agencies will ensure that up to $250,000 per depositor, per account ownership category, is secure. If you have more than $250,000 in a money market account, you'll get a Receiver's Certificate from the government agency. This document says you can claim funds once the bank's assets are liquidated. It isn't guaranteed that you'll get uninsured deposits back, though. While our guide highlights the top money market accounts with the highest interest rates, that isn't the only factor you should consider when choosing an account. Ideally, you want a low-fee money market account so bank fees don't reduce your interest earnings. Review the account's minimum opening deposit, monthly service fees, and interest rate requirements to determine whether a money market account is the best choice for you. Selecting the right bank can also make a big difference in your overall banking experience. For example, if traditional banking hours don't work for your schedule, then perhaps you'll want abank with 24/7 customer support. Or, if you want to open other bank accounts, you'll likely value a bank with a variety of account types in lieu of one that has limited services. Similar to other types of savings accounts, money market account rates can shift when theFederal Reservechanges the federal funds rate. Money market account rates tend to go up when the Fed raises the federal funds rate, and rates decline if the Fed starts making cuts. It's helpful to keep track ofFed meetingsso you know when the Federal Reserve may potentially implement changes. There are eight meetings scheduled per year, with the potential for more if needed. Money market account rates have declined since they peaked in the 2024, and it's likely they'll decline further throughout 2025. While money market account interest rates are often impacted by changes in economic conditions, banks also have their own criteria for changing rates. You can open a money market account online, at a branch, or by phone. Several of our top picks are online-only banks andcredit unions. If you choose an online-only financial institution, be aware that you won't have access to any physical locations, so you'll have to set up and manage your account solely online. When you're opening up a money market account, you typically need to have your Social Security number and U.S. ID to fill out the application. That said, thetop banks for immigrants and non-U.S. Citizensallow you to provide a foreign passport or Matricula Consular, too. Several of our top picks have a tiered interest rate, so you'll need to meet certain requirements to maximize your savings and get the highest APY. You might need to maintain a certain account balance, set up automatic transfers, or make a specific number of debit card purchases. If you don't think you can regularly meet those requirements, you might prefer a money market account that's more straightforward. Some money market accounts pay the same interest rate regardless of how much money you keep or what you do on the account. If you have a negative financial history, also know that you still have banking options available. You can look forsecond chance bank accounts, which are bank accounts that build your banking history. Like all bank accounts, you'll need to report the interest you earn from your money market account when you file your taxes. Interest is considered a form of income, so you'll need to pay both federal taxes and state taxes on it, depending on where you live and how much interest you make. You can use Form 1099-INT when filling out your tax return to let the IRS know what interest you earned. While bank accounts like money market accounts are one of the safest ways you can make money on your savings, they aren't entirely without risk. The biggest risk is that your financial institution might fail or somehow not be able to get you your money, but there are some protections in place to help mitigate that risk. Most banks are FDIC-insured, while most credit unions areNCUA-insured. Fintechs can't be insured by the federal government, but they generally partner with banks to provide FDIC insurance anyway. Both of these types of insurance work the same: your money is insured in your bank account up to $250,000 per depositor. That being said, money market accounts are more likely than other bank accounts to require you to keep that much money or more in your account to earn the highest rate. Some of these accounts offer enhanced FDIC insurance by spreading your money across several banks, but not every financial institution does this. If you choose to keep more money than federal insurance covers in your account, keep in mind that you could be opening yourself up to risk if your institution fails. Money market accounts are variable-rate accounts, which means that your bank can choose to change your interest rate at any time. This means there's some risk that your bank will lower your interest rate after you've opened an account. You're always free to move your money to another account, but doing that every time there's a rate change can be tiring. If you'd prefer a fixed interest rate, certificates of deposit ensure your rate will stay the same for the CD's term length. For example, if you open a1-year CD, your interest rate will not change for one year. If your money market account has a low interest rate, the interest rate you're earning on your money might be outpaced by theinflationrate, which means your money could actually lose value over time. Right now, you can get a money market account with an interest rate near 4% or 5%, while the general inflation rate is between 2% and 3%. If possible, you'll want to get a money market account that's well over the inflation rate to make sure you're not losing money. While money market accounts are generally easier to withdraw money from than savings accounts, there are still some limits to your liquidity. Many money market accounts charge excess withdrawal fees if you withdraw money more than six times per month. If you think you'll need to regularly make more withdrawals than that, you might prefer achecking account. The best high-yield savings accounts pay similar rates to the top money market accounts. The two accounts also share a similar purpose, so figuring out the best fit for you could come down to small preferences in features. High-yield savings accounts often have lower minimum opening deposits than money market accounts. If you do not have that much money to deposit upfront, high-yield savings accounts might be the way to go. However, if you want more account accessibility, money market accounts will be a lot more appealing to you than high-yield savings accounts. High-yield savings accounts do not give out paper checks, and rarely do they offer an ATM or debit card. Deciding between a money market account and ahigh-yield checking accountwill depend on how you plan to use your account. If you usually maintain a high account balance for expenses, a high-yield checking account is a great account option. However, you're better off with a money market account if you want to establish an emergency fund or save for your financial goals. Money market accounts and CDs are both great places to grow your savings. These accounts are managed very differently, though. Money market accounts are more accessible. You can deposit or withdraw money at any time. CDs only let you deposit money when you first open the account. You'll have to maintain all your money a CD until it reaches maturity or you'll face anearly withdrawal penalty. Interest earnings can also impact your decision. Thebest CD ratesare slightly higher than money market account rates. CDs also have a fixed interest rate, which means the rate stays the same until maturity. Money market accounts have a variable interest rate, so it can change at any time. Due to these differences, you might lean more toward a CD if you can set your money aside for a while in order to earn a fixed interest rate. If you need to add or take out money frequently and don't mind rate fluctuations, choose a money market account. Money market accounts are often confused with money market funds, but it should be noted that they are very different accounts.  A money market account is a type of bank account. Its protected by federal insurance in the event of a bank failure. A money market mutual fund is an investment option, and it isn't federally insured by the FDIC. There's the potential to earn more with a money market fund, but that's also because you're taking some risk — although money market funds are generally considered a low-risk investment, you could still potentially lose money in a money market fund. Meanwhile, money market accounts are protected for up to $250,000 per depositor at banks by the FDIC and at credit unions by the NCUA. You also have a better idea of what your annual rate of return will be with money market accounts than with money market funds, although neither offers a fixed interest rate. Money market accounts could be a good choice for money you don't want to lose, such as emergency funds or short-term savings goals. Money marketmutual fundsare a better choice for long-term savings goals or for money you're not afraid to lose. Yes, money market accounts are safe. The money in your account is insured by the FDIC orNCUA. The money market account with the highest interest rate right now is theBrilliant Bank Surge Money Market Account, which pays 4.50% APY. Keep in mind rates fluctuate along with the federal funds rate, so banks that offer the highest APY now might not down the road, and ones with lower rates now could hike their rates later. Interest rates on money market accounts closely follow thefederal funds rate. That is to say, rates are variable and can change multiple times per year based on the Federal Reserve's decisions. No, money market account rates have been dropping because the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates a few times already. It's forecasted that more rate drops could happen in 2025, which could also impact money market account rates further. To learn more about what makes a good money market account and how to choose the best fit, four experts weighed in: We're focusing on what will make a money market account most useful, including APY, access to your money, and more. Here's what they had to say about money market accounts. (Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.) What makes a money market account good or not good? Sophia Acevedo, banking editor,Business Insider: ""A good money market account generally provides several ways to access your money, like a debit card, ATM card, or paper checks."" Roger Ma, CFP® professional and author of""Work Your Money, Not Your Life"": ""I don't really recommend a money market account for parking your money. I don't know if their fees are really that competitive versus high-yield savings accounts. For most people, I think what makes sense is a high-yield savings account for youremergency fundand any short-term goals."" How should someone decide whether to put their money in a money market account or another interest-earning account? Tania Brown, CFP® professional and vice president of coaching strategy atOfColor: ""So I guess we'll start off with how much money you want to put in and the level of transactions you want to have.

Mykail James, MBA, certified financial education instructor,BoujieBudgets.com: ""How soon do you need the money? What kind of access do you need to it? And if you want your money to grow and you want to keep temptation away, then I would put it in a CD."" Sophia Acevedo, Business Insider: ""I would create a list of what I prioritize most in a bank account. For example, some banks have accounts that charge monthly service fees. I would look to see what the requirements are for waiving themonthly maintenance feeand whether I think I could feasibly meet those requirements each month.

Best CD Rates,"At the last Fed meeting, theFederal Reserve kept interest rates steady. Fed rates tend to impact CD rates, so it's expected that CD rates will stay relatively stable until the next Fed meeting which is happening later this month. That said, CD rates are likely to continue falling throughout 2025. At Business Insider, we keep track of over 160 financial institutions across the U.S. and list the best CDs currently offered. We report the highest CD rates every day to help you find the right CD. We report on standard CDs with term lengths ranging from 3 months to 5 years. We also report on no-penalty CDs, CDs with no minimum opening deposits, and other specialty CDs. In addition to nationwide CD rates, we give the best CD rate found at a local financial institution to give you an idea of the CD market as a whole. The best CD rate we've found is 9.50% APY from California Coast Credit Union Celebration Certificate. However, the credit union has a small footprint for eligible applicants, and there are caps on the amount of CD earnings. Credit unions offer many of the best current CD rates right now. But don't worry —anyone is eligible to join these credit unionsand open CDs. CDs aren't as accessible as othertypes of savings accounts, so keep in mind how long you can keep money in the account so you can avoid potentially facing early withdrawal penalties. Also, make sure you know what steps you need to take once your CD term ends. Thebest banksand credit unions for CDs offer a high rate on CDs with good perks and low minimum opening deposits. Our top picks for CDs are protected by federal insurance. Bear in mind money is safe at a federally insured financial institution. When a financial institution is FDIC- orNCUA-insured, up to $250,000 per depositor, per account category is secure in a bank account. If two or more banks offer the same rate, we choose the most well-rounded account as our overall top pick. We take into consideration factors like minimum opening deposit requirements, early withdrawal penalties, and the overall banking experience in addition to the interest rate. Here are the best CD rates as picked by Business Insider editors. California Coast Credit Union currently offers a limited-time 5-month Celebration Certificate offering a whopping 9.50% APY CD rate. It requires a low minimum deposit of $500. It's hard to find a 5% or6% interest rate CDright now, much less a CD with as high an interest rate as this. However, the criteria you need to meet in order to open the certificate are steep. First of all, you can only put a maximum of $3,000 in the CD. Second of all, the money in the CD has to be new, which means it can't have previously been in a California Coast Credit Union account. You'll also need some sort of other account with California Coast Credit Union to get the high APY. You can have an activechecking account(meaning it has one transaction a month), a new money market account with a minimum balance of $5,000, a new regular certificate with a minimum balance of $5,000, a new IRA certificate with a minimum balance of $5,000, or a new funded consumer loan that isn't either a credit card or a share-secured or certificate-secured loan. You also need to be a member of California Coast Credit Union. Membership is limited to people who live or work in San Diego or Riverside counties, to people in select employee groups, and to people who live with a member. Term options:California Coast Credit Union has terms ranging from 3 months to 5 years, as well as a 5-month celebration certificate, an 8-month liquid certificate, and an 18-month bump rate certificate. Penalties:California Coast Credit Union certificates have the following early withdrawal penalties: Climate First Bank currently offers the best no-penalty CD rate you can find. It's also an eco-friendly bank and anLGBTQ-friendly bank. It has several environmental certifications, and it offers the Climate First Bank Pride Banking, which is a checking account that lets customers use their chosen name and correct pronouns. Climate First Bank doesn't offer many other CDs, and the CDs it does offer have less competitive interest rates. If you're hoping to open multiple CDs with the same bank, you might prefer some of our other options. Term options:Climate First offers a 6-month and a 1-year no-penalty CD, as well as a 15-month flex CD. Penalties:Climate First Bank's no-penalty CD does not charge early withdrawal penalties. Brilliant Bank, an online division of Equity Bank, is the best bank for 3-month CD rates. It also has a minimum opening deposit of $1,000, which is pretty standard for most banks. Brilliant Bank might not be the best choice for building a CD ladder, though. It only offers limited term options online, and all are under 18 months. If you're interested in longer term lengths, other banks may be a better fit. Term options:Brilliant Bank has online term lengths between 3 months and 15 months. Penalties:The early withdrawal penalty for the 3-month term ishalf of the interest the CD has yet to earn. A TotalBank CD may be appealing if you're searching for a 6-month term available nationwide. TotalDirectBank CDs have a steep minimum opening deposit of $25,000 and a maximum deposit of $1 million. TotalDirectBank is the online-only division of the City National Bank of Florida. The online division doesn't operate in Florida, Somoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, or the U.S. Virgin Islands. Term options:TotalDirectBank has terms ranging from 3 months to 5 years. Penalties:The following early withdrawal penalties may apply to TotalDirectBank CDs: Credit Human offers good rates on several of its certificates, especially its 1-year, 18-month, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year, and 5-year certificates. Keep in mind that USALLIANCE Financial offers the same rate on 2-year CDs, though. All of its CDs come in 1-month term length increments, and it offers CDs with term lengths of up to 10 years. If you're looking for CDs that have a lot of flexibility around term lengths, Credit Human certificates might be a good choice for you. Credit Human's membership eligibility requirements are easy to meet by credit union standards. The easiest way to join is by becoming a member of the American Consumer Council. You can also join by living in certain parts of San Antonio or New Orleans or by being related to a current Credit Human member, among other methods. Terms:Credit Human CDs have term lengths ranging from 3 months to 10 years. Penalties:Credit Human early withdrawal penalties are the greater of $50 or the following penalties: Below, you'll find our picks for the best CD rates right now. There isn't one particular CD that will work for everyone, but we combed through offerings at around a dozen national banks to find the strongest options available right now. If more than three CDs share the top rate, we put the three highest-rated CDs in our guide. We also ordered CDs from highest to lowest editorial rating if they offered the same rate so you know which ones are the most well-rounded options. Locking your money into an account in exchange for a higher interest rate can be a big decision. Here's what you need to know about common CD terms. Most CDs charge you a fee if you need to withdraw money from your account before the term ends. But with a no-penalty CD, you won't have to pay an early withdrawal penalty. The best no-penalty CDs will offer rates slightly higher than thebest high-yield savings accountsand can offer a substantially improved interest rate over traditional brick-and-mortar savings accounts. However, there may be other reasons for wanting to open asavings account versus a no-penalty CD. Carefully review both accounts and see which is a better fit for reaching your needs. Thebest 6-month CDsare offering interest rates around 4.5%. Six-month CDs are best for those who are looking for elevated rates on their savings for short-term gains, but are uncomfortable having limited access to their cash in the long term. These can be a good option for those who may just be getting started with saving, or who don't have a largeemergency fundfor unexpected expenses. Thebest 1-year CDsalso offer around 4.5%, and are a popular option for many investors. A 1-year term can be an attractive option for someone building a CD ladder, or for someone who has a reasonable cash safety net but is still concerned about long-term expenses. Financial planners often recommend thisCD strategyof laddering several terms so that you have additional flexibility while still being able to lock in higher rates. Thebest 2-year CD rateswill be slightly lower than 1-year and no-penalty CD rates. In exchange for a longer lock-in period, investors receive a long-term commitment for a specific rate. These are best used as part of a CD ladder strategy, or for those worried about a declining rate market in the foreseeable future. Thebest 3-year CDstend to have rates that are comparable to 2-year CDs. These are usually less popular for your average investor, but can be an important lever when diversifying investments and hedging against the risk of unfavorable rate markets in the long term. Thebest 5-year CDswill offer lower rates than the other terms on our list, but are still popular options for investors. These CDs are best for those looking to lock in high rates for the long term. CDs are generally viewed as safe investment vehicles, and securing a favorable rate can yield considerable earnings in year three and beyond — even if rates fall elsewhere. Ajumbo CDis a type of CD with a much higher minimum opening deposit than the average traditional CD. In exchange, jumbo CDs usually offer better rates than you would find with traditional CDs. If you have a lot of money to put in a CD, jumbo CDs might be a good choice for you. Bump-up CDsare a type of CD that lets you raise your CD rate once during the term length if your financial institution's rates go up. These are also sometimes called bump-rate CDs or raise-your-rate CDs. Some banks and credit unions let you raise your rate more than once, so if that's something you're interested in, you should check with your financial institution before you open the CD. Step-up CDsare similar to bump-up CDs in that their special features center around raising the interest rate you get on your CD. However, step-up CD rates are locked in when you open the CD; you'll know exactly when your rate will raise, and by how much, when you open the CD. For example, an 18-month step-up CD might start at 1% APY, orannual percentage yield, raise to 1.5% APY after 6 months, and raise to 2% APY after a year. These rate raises aren't dependent on market fluctuations like bump-up CDs are. IRA CDsare a type of retirement account. They work just like traditional CDs, but they have different rules when it comes to the taxes you pay and the way you withdraw money. IRA CDs can be traditional IRAs, which defer the taxes you pay on your money until you're ready to withdraw it, or Roth IRAs, which you pay taxes on up-front but are otherwise tax-exempt if you withdraw your money when you're retirement age. You'll have to pay early withdrawal fees on any money you withdraw from IRA CDs before their term lengths are up. But depending on how old you are and what type of IRA it is, you might have to also pay taxes and penalties on what you withdraw. If you have a non-IRA CD, you'll need to pay taxes on the interest your CDs make each year. As long as you aren't withdrawing money from your early, you won't have to pay taxes yearly on your IRA CDs. When opening a CD, one of the most important things to consider is the interest rate. CD rates are impacted by the Federal Reserve's decisions. As a result of the Fed's latest rate cuts, CD rates have been declining. There are still a fewCDs offering 5% interest, although they're primary from local financial institutions. Keep in mind it's also likely that CD rates will drop in the future. Notably, there's less room forlong-term CD rates when rates declinesince accounts offer around 4% APY, while short-term CDs are still paying just under 4.75% APY. While the interest rate is important, you'll also want to make sure other aspects of the CD fit your needs, too. Consider whether you want ashort-term CD vs. a long-term CDand act accordingly; you don't want to end up hit by early withdrawal penalties because you took out a CD with a too-long term length, and you don't want to miss out on savings because you took out a short-term CD and interest rates dropped. You'll also want to consider types of CDs, too. If you're interested in the best CD rates for seniors, for example, you might want to look for CDs that give better interest rates for senior citizens. And if you're interested in planning for retirement, you might want to consider IRA CDs over traditional CDs. Make sure that the bank or credit union is FDIC- or NCUA-insured before putting money in a financial institution. FDIC insurance keeps your money safe in banks up to $250,000 per person, per account type. NCUA insurance works similarly but is only for credit unions. If you have a limited amount of money to put in a CD, you'll want to check what the minimum opening deposit is for the CD. A minimum opening deposit of $1,000 is fairly standard, but you can find CDs that permit a deposit of $0 upfront. If you're looking to open a much larger CD, jumbo CDs usually have minimum opening deposits that are far higher than those for standard CDs. If you're not certainhow much money to deposit into a CD, think about what you're saving money for and create a savings goal that can help make this idea more tangible. Setting up a timeline can also help you determine how much you'll need to deposit upfront to reach your end goal. If you aren't sure whether you can keep money in a CD for its entire term length, you'll want to check what early withdrawal penalties your CD charges. This generally takes the form of deducting a certain amount of interest from your account, such as 90 days' interest for a 6-month CD. Acompound interest calculatorcan help you figure out exactly how much this is for your CD. If you want to be able to withdraw money without incurring these penalties, you'll probably want to go for ano-penalty CD. No-penalty CDs let you withdraw your money without penalty in exchange for generally slightly lower interest rates. Some bank accounts come with monthly service fees, which will automatically deduct a small fee from your account each month. Luckily, you generally don't have to worry about these for CDs; they're more commonly found on checking accounts,money market accounts, and traditional savings accounts. However, you should always check before opening a CD to make sure there aren't any fees associated with the account. It's important to make sure the financial institution you open a CD with is trustworthy and safe. Before opening a CD with a bank orcredit union, check their BBB page, see if they've been involved in any recent lawsuits, and research whether they've had any recent data breaches. You might also want to consider banking with aneco-friendly bank, a minority depository institution, or a community development financial institution. These banks use the money you put in your accounts to help the environment and underserved populations. Generally, your CDs will auto-renew at the end of the term length, giving you a short window when the original CD closes to choose not to renew. There are a few things to look out for with CD auto-renewal. If interest rates have changed since you opened the original CD, your new CD with have the updated interest rate. If interest rates have fallen, you'll probably want to close out your CD instead of auto-renewing. Additionally, many promotional CDs with auto-renew into one of the bank's standard CDs with much worse interest rates. Make sure you understand what your CD will renew into at the end of the term length so you can take appropriate action. Just like any interest-bearing account, you'll be taxed on the interest income you earn from your CD. If you have a CD, you'll need to fill out a 1099-INT form when you file your taxes with the IRS. If you have a traditional IRA CD that you withdraw from early, you'll need to pay taxes on everything you withdraw since traditional IRAs are a before-tax account. This tax is in addition to whatever CD early withdrawal penalties you have to pay.Tax softwarecan help make sure you're filing your CD taxes correctly. In general, you'll earn a much higher rate with a CD compared to traditional, brick-and-mortar savings accounts; average CD rates far outpaceaverage savings account interest rates. You'll also be locking in your rate; CDs come with a fixed interest rate, while savings accounts have variable interest that can change at any time. That being said, savings accounts give you much easier access to your money than CDs, and high-yield savings accounts from online financial institutions also offer great interest rates. Money market accounts are like traditional savings accounts, but they usually have a tiered interest rate structure that gives you a better interest rate the more money you put in the account. They also sometimes come with checks or other ways to access the money besidesACH transfersor wire transfers. If you're planning on putting a lot of money into a money market account, its interest rate might be competitive with the interest rates CDs offer. And they're a better choice if you want easy access to your money. But high CD interest rates are easier to earn than high money market interest rates, andaverage money market ratesare lower than average CD rates. CD interest rates are also locked in, while money market accounts have variable rates. Bonds and CDs are similar in that they both offer fixed interest. While most other savings accounts have an interest rate that can change at any time, you can lock in a rate for a specific length of time with bonds and CDs. One big difference betweenbonds vs. CDsis that CDs are a banking product, while bonds are traded. CDs are federally insured through the FDIC, while bonds aren't, although you can get treasury bonds from the federal government that are similarly low-risk. That being said, depending on market conditions, bonds might offer a higher rate than CDs. Bonds also tend to be longer-term, and some bonds, such astreasury bonds, are tax-advantaged. Banks and credit unions base their CD rates on several different economic factors. One of the biggest economic factors is the Federal Reserve. TheFederal Reserveis the central banking system of the U.S., and the rates it sets inform the rates that banks and credit unions set. Since CDs have a fixed rate of return, CD rates are based on both the currentfederal funds rateand what banks and credit unions expect the federal funds rate to be in the future. Banks and credit unions also need to stay competitive with each other to be successful, so financial institutions also base their rates on what other financial institutions are offering. When looking for where to find the best CD rates, you'll want to consider several factors, including interest rate, minimum opening deposit,early withdrawal penalties, and bank safety. You'll also want to factor what banks and credit unions are accessible to you. If you know you don't enjoy online banking, you'll probably want to choose a brick-and-mortar bank or local credit union, even if their rates aren't as good as the ones in this article. Sometimes, opening just one CD isn't the best option for your savings. ACD ladderstrategy can give you more flexibility and liquidity than a regular CD while still letting you lock in a great rate for a significant amount of time. To open a CD ladder, you just open multiple CDs with different term lengths at once. For example, if you have $120,000 you want to put in a CD, instead of putting all of that money into just one CD, you spread it across several. For example, you might open a 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year CD, putting $40,000 in each. That way, you'll have some of your money back within a year in case of an emergency, but you'll be earning a great interest rate for three years. You don't need to open these CDs at the same bank, which means you'll have more flexibility to choose CDs with the best rates or features. CD ladders can help mitigate the risk that you'll need to withdraw your funds before the CD's term length is up. This makes it a low-risk way to diversify your portfolio. That being said, CDs won't earn you as much money on average as investments do. You'll get a guaranteed growth rate with CDs, but you'll get a higher rate overall, albeit with some amount of risk, with abrokerage accountor other investment strategy. We consulted banking and financial planning experts to inform these picks and provide their advice on finding the best CDs to use for your money. You can read their insights at the bottom of this post. Here's what they had to say about CDs. (Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.) What makes a CD good or not good? Mykail James, MBA, certified financial education instructor,BoujieBudgets.com: ""You always want to look at how much money you need to start up. And then if you can continuously add money in. Also, check not just what the interest rate is, but how often they pay out interest, whether it's monthly or quarterly."" How should someone choose a CD term length?

""I believe in having a plan for whatever the funds are.

Methodology: How We Chose the Best CDs At Business Insider, we aim to help you make smart decisions with your money. We thoroughly research banking products with the goal of providing helpful content about personal finance. Business Insider's personal finance team is editorially independent, which means our business team does not decide how we cover products and what we write about. You can read oureditorial standards pageto learn more about how we review and choose products in greater detail. In order to choose the best CDs, we reviewed over 160 financial institutions. All banks included on our list areFDIC-insured, while credit union CDs offer insurance through NCUA. We've selected the top CD offerings from banks and credit unions using ourbank account methodology. We rate bank products on a scale from one to five stars, with one star being the lowest rating and five star being the highest rating possible. For CDs, we consider what terms are offered, along with the accounts' minimum opening deposit requirements, interest rates, fees, miscellaneous features, and early withdrawal penalties. We also consider the financial institution's customer service options, ethics, security and mobile app ratings. We score each of these features on a scale of zero to five, then calculate the weighted average to determine the account's total rating. If two banks offered the same APY on a CD product, we considered factors like minimum deposit requirements and early withdrawal penalties. The highest-paying CD rate right now is available at California Coast Credit Union. It has 5-month celebration certificate paying 9.50% APY, but this CD special only allows a $3,000 maximum opening deposit and requires you to have another bank account with the credit union that meets certain requirements. To become a member and open a certificate, you must live, work, or go to school in San Diego or Riverside counties or be part of select employee groups. You can know if a bank or credit union offering the best CDs is safe by checking for federal insurance. For banks, make sure they have FDIC insurance, and for credit unions, make sure they have NCUA insurance. CDs are a good investmentif interest rates are currently high and/or expected to fall. The biggest benefit of a CD is your ability to lock in a fixed interest rate. If interest rates fall during the term of your CD, the APY on your CD will not be affected. Conversely, if rates are expected to rise, then it may not be a good time to put money in a CD. Higher CD rates aren't coming. In fact, the Fed cut interest rates in its September, November, and December 2024 meetings. It's expected that rates will continue to drop through 2025. The Fed's economic projections indicate that CD rates might continue to fall as far in the future as 2027. No, you currently can't get7% interest on a CD. However, the California Coast Credit Union Celebration Certificate is currently offering an even higher interest rate of 9.50% APY. You'll have to meet some pretty strict requirements, though, such as living in specific parts of California. *Axos ONE Savings and Checking Bundle: Earn 4.86% APY on your savings account balance and 0.51% APY on yoaur checking account balance by getting at least $1,500 in monthly direct deposits by the 25th of each month and by maintaining an average daily balance of $1,500.

Checking account monthly service fee:no monthly service fee Banks typically offer bonuses on checking accounts to draw in new customers. Bonuses also help create a distinction between competing banks that may offer similar interest rates, monthly fees, or opening deposit requirements. Current bank account promotion offers range from $50 to $4,000. Generally, brick-and-mortar banks are more likely to offer bank account bonuses to new customers than online banks or banking platforms. In addition to the tips mentioned below, make sure you qualify to open a bank account at a specific financial institution. You typically need a U.S. ID and Social Security number to apply for an account. However, if you are unbanked because you don't have a U.S. ID, know that you have options. Thetop banks for immigrants and non-U.S. Citizensallow you to provide a foreign passport or Matricula Consular to open a bank account. The first step to qualifying for a checking account bonus is opening your account under the correct conditions. You must apply through a bank promotional page or use a special code to open a bank account through a bank representative. If you open a bank account without these conditions, you won't be able to get the bonus. Each financial institution will list certain requirements you must meet by a specified timeframe. You might need to make a direct deposit or transfer, maintain a specific daily balance, and/or enroll in online banking to get the bonus. Some banks may also require a combination of these requirements. Generally, bank accounts with higher cash bonuses will have harder bonus criteria to meet. For example, you may need to deposit $25,000 or more in your account within the first 90 days and maintain that balance amount for a few months. The disclosure at the bottom of a promotional page will provide more details to help you understand the qualification criteria. For example, many disclosures outline who can qualify for a bonus and who can't. It will also tell you which specific transactions are eligible to meet the requirements. Make sure you read that to see if you truly qualify. Once you've completed all the requirements specified by the bank, the bonus will be deposited into your account. You'll also need to keep your bank account open for a certain time period to keep the bonus and avoid paying an early account closure fee. A few financial institutions, like Chase and SoFi®, have bank account bonuses for existing customers. Banks typically offer existing customers bank promotions when they want you to upgrade to a premium bank account with higher minimum balance requirements or utilize a specific banking feature. For example, you might be asked to set updirect deposits. Remember, though, that most bonus promotions are for new bank account customers. Some banks will still let you qualify as a new customer if you've opened a bank account with them in the past, but they'll list a specific time that needs to have passed. Checking account bonuses are taxable. Similar to interest, any money that you earn from a checking account is taxed as ordinary income. The exact rate you'll pay depends onwhich tax bracket you're in, which can range anywhere from 10% to 37%. You have to pay taxes on checking account bonuses by Tax Day in April. At the beginning of the year, banks will usually send a1099-INT formby mail which you can use when filing your tax return. Even if you don't receive this form, you should still include the bonus in your tax return. Evaluating the best bank promotion deals requires more than simply checking the bonus requirements. After all, you want to make sure that yourbank account bonus is worth itand that the account actually fits your needs. Here are three steps you can take to choose the best bank bonus offer. Think about whichtypes of checking accountyou want and where you want to get it. Do you want a traditional checking account at a brick-and-mortar bank or a rewards checking account from an online bank? Are you looking for an everyday banking option that has minimal maintenance requirements, or do you want to get a premium bank account that offers more rewards for maintaining a high account balance? Once you've narrowed down your options, review a couple of institutions to see if bonuses are available. For example, you'll likely find several offers if you want a traditional checking account with a national brick-and-mortar bank. You can compare the requirements and cash bonus values and see if there's a standout option. When you're opening a checking account, you shouldn't just look at the bonus. Think about whether this account actually fits your needs and if there are any features outside of the bonus that actually appeal to you. For example, some checking accounts have early pay features so you can get paycheck direct deposits ahead of payday. Typcially, you can get early direct deposits up to two days early at many brick-and-mortar and online banks. Other features that can significantly impact your banking experience are the bank's online and mobile banking tools. The banks with thebest mobile banking appshave tools to help you manage your spending and savings. For example, you might be able to create individual savings goals or track monthly spending. Some apps also have strong security features, so you can lock your debit card or get information about how to improve your security when you log into your account online. You don't want to open a bank account at a financial institution where you'll have to pay exorbitant bank fees because it isn't a good fit.Common bank feesyou'll find include monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees, ATM fees, and early account closure fees. Make sure you meet the requirements to waive fees on your account. For example, many banks let you waive fees onmonthly bank maintenance feesif you maintain a certain daily account balance. Otherwise, you might be better off getting afree checking account, so you can properly maintain your account without facing common bank charges. You can waiveATM feesby sticking primarily to your bank's ATM network. Some banks also offer ATM fee reimbursements, so you can get refunded for charges from outside providers. There's usually a monthly ATM fee reimbursement limit, typically only up to $10 or $20 per month. If you are concerned about overdrawing from your account, you choose a bank that offersoverdraft protection. Coverage for overage varies by bank, but the best is a free option that lets you link your checking to your savings account. In addition to reviewing bank account fees, assess other bank accounts and services. If you're looking to buy a home or open acredit cardsoon, it may be worthwhile to check out a bank to see if it could be a good option for future goals. Here are tips you can use to maximize a bank account bonus: We consulted banking and financial planning experts to inform these picks and provide their advice on finding the best bank account bonus for your needs. Here's what they had to say about bank account bonuses. (Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.) What should I look for in a checking account bonus? Mykail James, MBA, certified financial education instructor,BoujieBudgets.com: ""If you are using this bank as your main spending account, then you know that you will have less conflict with depositing money in there. It may be beneficial to look at specific things that are getting bonuses, specifically direct deposit."" Sophia Acevedo, banking editor,Business Insider: ""I would consider how much money is needed to obtain the bonus. Some banks may have several bonuses available, where you'll earn bigger bonuses for a higher account balance or direct deposit. See if a particular bonus is right for you and you're not going out of your way to qualify for it.""

Our team is editorially independent, which means our editorial team chooses how we cover and review products. Our business does not decide that. You can read oureditorial standards pageto learn more about how we review and choose products. To choose the best checking account bonuses, we reviewed national banks, regional banks, and credit unions to find out which ones offered existing bonuses. Then, we looked at the criteria for getting the bonuses as well as the overall bank account structure. We included bank account bonuses where the checking account has at least 3.5/5 stars. In ourbank account methodology, we rate all checking accounts on a scale from one to five stars. One star is the lowest rating and five stars is the highest possible rating. Specifically for checking accounts, we review minimum opening deposit requirements, monthly service fees, overdraft protection, and fees, ATM network and fees, customer support availability, mobile app rating, miscellaneous features, and company ethics and security. We score each of these features on a scale of zero to five, then calculate the weighted average to get an account's final rating.

Your debit card pulls money from your checking account whenever you use it. This is different fromhow credit cards work, since those are essentially short-term loans that come with costly interest payments if you don't pay your bill each month. The best rewards debit cards can let you earn a bit of money off of purchases you would be making anyway, such as gas or grocery purchases.

Keep in mind that you might end up paying expensiveoverdraft feesif you use your debit card to make purchases you can't cover, though. Generally, cash-back debit cards work by letting you earn some amount of cash back after making purchases with it. There's frequently some sort of limit on what types of purchases you can earn cash-back on; some cards might limit what brands you can buy to earn cash-back, and some might only give cash-back on certain types of purchases, such as buying gas. Some might require you to select what you want to earn cash back from in yourmobile banking app. The cash can be delivered to you in various ways, as well; it might be put in yourchecking accountautomatically, or you might be able to redeem your cash for gift cards or rewards. You might consider a cash-back debit card if you're looking for a way to get some money back from your purchases. Some banks and online banking platforms, such asonline banksand apps that offer banking services, offer accounts with high-reward cash-back debit cards, which allow you to earn a percentage of cash back from certain types of debit card purchases. When decidinghow to get a debit cardwith cash-back options you'll regularly use, consider what you generally buy with your debit card. Do you use your debit card primarily for grocery purchases? Do you use your debit card mostly for online shopping? Make sure to find a card that will reward you for the purchases you make most often. Look into how you'll receive your cash back before you commit to a card. For example, If you don't want to have to redeem your cash back for gift cards or other types of rewards, look for a card that puts your cash directly into your checking account. Many cash-back debit cards come with fees. Look for afree checking accountthat has a cash-back debit card with no fees to make sure you aren't paying more in monthly fees than you're earning back. Additionally, make sure that the requirements the debit card puts on how you earn cash back aren't too strict. If you can only buy from specific brands, and you never buy from those brands, you'll be missing out on the core features of your card. The best rewards debit card for you will depend on your spending habits. Make sure to choose a cash-back debit card that applies to purchases you generally make. If a debit card comes with a great cash-back rate for specific retailers you don't use, it won't be as useful to you as a card with a low cash-back rate that applies to everything. You'll also want to make sure you're happy with the checking account connected to the cash-back card. You'll want to make sure youavoid bank feeswith your checking account so any cash you make back on purchases isn't eaten up by monthly service fees. While we only have nationwide cash-back debit cards in our list of the best debit cards, local banks andcredit unionscan also offer great rates on cash-back debit cards. Before deciding on a debit card, make sure to see if any local financial institutions offer cash-back debit cards with strong perks. A good cash-back rate on a debit card depends just as much on what the rate applies to as its percentage. A 1% cash-back rate on a debit card can be good as long as it applies to most purchases. If the cash-back rate applies to only a few purchases, you'll want to aim for a higher rate, but it's rare for a cash-back rate to be as high as even 4%. Applying for a cash-back debit card will generally be the same process ashow to open a checking account. You'll need to fill out an application, either online, over the phone, or at a physical branch. You'll need to provide some personal information, such as your name, your Social Security number, and your physical address. If the cash-back debit card you open doesn't have an associated checking account, your process might be different. The best way to maximize your earnings with a cash-back debit card is to plan ahead on what purchases you make with your debit card. If your debit card's cash back only applies to purchases with certain brands, you'll want to shop with those brands whenever you can. Depending on your circumstances, you might want to mix and match different cash-back credit cards and cash-back debit cards to try and maximize what purchases you're earning cash back from. Just keep in mind that, depending on the cards you open, you might be losing more money onmonthly bank maintenance feesand other bank charges than you're earning from your purchases. If you choose a cash-back debit card with a checking account, make sure that the account is either FDIC- or NCUA-insured before you open the account. FDIC insurance is offered for banks, whileNCUA insuranceis offered for credit unions. Financial technology companies with banking services can still offer federally-insured checking accounts by partnering with a bank. With FDIC and NCUA insurance, the money in your account will be insured in case your financial institution fails. You'll be insured for $250,000 in a single-depositor account and $500,000 in ajoint bank account. If you have more than that in your checking account, it will not be insured in case of a bank failure. The primary difference between cash-back debit cards and cash-back credit cards is the pool of money that the cards pull from. Credit cards are lines of credit; each time you use one, you're borrowing money from the credit card lender that you're expected to pay back. If you don't, you'll have to pay interest on what you've borrowed. Theaverage credit card interest rateis extremely high, so you'll want to pay your balance off each month to avoid paying extra. In comparison, debit cards generally pull money from a checking account, although there areprepaid debit cardsthat work differently. Since it's pulling from your money, you aren't at risk of going into debt by making debit card purchases. But you also won't be able to make debit card purchases if you don't have any money in your checking account. Both cash-back debit cards andhigh-yield checking accountsoffer ways to make money off of your checking account. While cash-back debit cards let you make money off of your purchases, high-yield checking accounts let you make money off of the money you keep in your checking account. High-yield checking accounts come with high interest rates — sometimes even higher than what you can find fromhigh-yield savings accounts. In return, these accounts usually have very strict requirements, such as only letting you earn the rate on a small part of your balance or requiring you to make a certain amount of debit card purchases each month. Cash-back debit cards might be easier to use, although you probably won't make as much money from them. And while high-yield checking accounts can come with cash-back debit cards, it's pretty rare. Most of the time, you'll need to choose between the two. Business Insider's personal finance team is editorially independent; you can learn more about how we review products through oureditorial standards page. For our top picks, we looked at national, regional, and local banks that had bank accounts with cash-back debit cards. We rate bank products on a scale from one to five stars, with one star being the lowest rating, three stars being an in-between rating, and five stars being the highest rating possible. We use a weighted average to get our star rating, which means we weigh certain features, like interest rates and fees, at a higher weight percentage than others. We understand that these areas can more heavily impact a person's overall banking experience. Yes, cash-back debit cards are generally safe. They're usually linked to your checking accounts, which are federally insured bank accounts. No. Debit cards don't report to credit bureaus, so they won't impact your credit score directly. However, using debit cards instead of credit cards can help you avoid credit card debt, so using debit cards could help your credit score indirectly that way. We chose Discover, LendingClub, and Varo Bank as some of the best banks for cash-back debit cards. Yes, some banks offerchecking accounts for teensthat come with cash-back debit cards. These accounts can also be useful for people who want to get a cash-back debit card for students. Cash-back debit cards may come with fees and reward caps. They might offer lower rewards rates than cash-back credit cards.",https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/cash-back-debit-cards

You can use your debit card at over 70,000 ATMs nationwide for free, but unlike many online banks, Capital One doesn't reimburse any fees charged by out-of-network ATM providers. Capital One savings accountand CD rates are also higher than the national average, so it could be beneficial to open multiple bank accounts if that's your preference. Although Capital One 360 is considered an online bank, the institution does have some physical branches. There are over 280 branches in seven U.S. states, plus around 50 Capital One Cafés, where you can grab Verve Coffee, speak with a money coach, and open a bank account. As a Capital One checking customer, you can get money from 70,000+ fee-free Capital One, MoneyPass and Allpoint ATMs—including in select Target, Walgreens and CVS stores. Chase has branches in more states than Bank of America or Wells Fargo. The bank also has numerous types of bank account, and you could get perks such as relationship rates if you open multiple bank accounts. Chase is notably featured in our guides for thebest kids savings accountsand best national banks. You'll pay a monthly service fee if you don't meet certain account requirements. You'll also have to pay a fee if you use an out-of-network ATM. Chase has over 4,700 branches throughout the continental U.S., and around 16,000 ATMs. Axos offers five different checking accounts, all geared toward specific needs: You'll need at least $250 to open ahigh-yield savings account. Some of the options on our list do not require an initial deposit. There are also several requirements to earn up to 3.30% APY with anAxos Bank Rewards Checkingaccount.

You have free access to around 91,000 ATMs. Axos doesn't have a specific ATM network, but you can likely use one near you for free. Axos also offers generous out-of-network ATM fee reimbursements, in case you can't find a free ATM close by. Discover is a good option for people who want to do all their banking,investing, and borrowing with one institution. It offers a wide range of products, including credit cards. The bank is a good option if you want to earn cash back with your debit card — you'll earn 1% cash back on up to $3,000 in purchases per month (see website for details). You also don't need to place an inital deposit for a checking, savings, CD, or money market account. Discover has just one physical branch, in Delaware. You have free access to over 60,000 ATMs in the Allpoint and MoneyPass networks. Ally is one of thebest online banksbecause it offers strong banking and investing products. You can get a high-yield savings account, a money market account, regular CDs, a no-penalty CD, and bump-up CDs. That's more variety than most other banks have. Ally is also one of the few banks that doesn't have minimum opening deposits for any of its accounts, so you can start online banking with any amount. The Ally Savings Account stands out in particular because it bucketing feature to help you save money for financial goals. You can create a bucket for an Emergency Fund or Travel, and then separate money in your savings for that specific goal. Ally also has one of thebest investment apps for beginners. If you're looking for a robo-advisor to get started with investing, it's also a solid choice. Synchrony pays 4.00% APY on its high-yield savings account, which is great compared to other well-known banks. It doesn't require a minimum opening deposit, and there are no monthly fees. Unlike most savings accounts, it comes with an ATM card so you can easily access your savings. Synchrony only offers a high-yield savings account, CDs, and a money market account — not a checking account. If you need to transfer money from your Synchrony account to an external checking account, it could take a few business days. But keep in mind that Synchrony makes it easier to access your money than most banks without checking accounts, because it gives you an ATM card. Synchrony is an online-only bank, so it doesn't have any branches. Although it doesn't have its own ATM network, you can use ATMs in the Plus, STAR, or NYCE ATM networks for free. Synchrony also reimburses up to $5 per month for any fees charged by an out-of-network machine. TD Bank is ranked third in JD Power's 2024 U.S. National Banking Satisfaction Study. Many branch locations are open seven days per week, which is great if you struggle to make it to the bank during the workday. TD Bank's ATM fees aren't necessarily higher than other banks' fees, but its fine print may affect which checking account you choose to open. Just be aware that theTD Bank Beyond Checking Accountis the only TD Bank checking account that doesn't charge a fee when you non-TD Bank ATMs — and you must maintain a $2,500 balance for TD Bank to reimburse fees charged by out-of-network ATM operators. TD Bank has over 1,100 branch locations across 16 states, with about 2,600 ATMs. TotalBank is an online-only financial institution. TotalBank offers some of thebest CD ratesavailable nationwide. It offers a high APY for 3-month, 6-month, 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year CDs. TotalBank CDs pay 4.11% to 4.51% APY. TotalBank also may be worth considering for a money market account, too. The TotalBank Online Money Market pays up to 4.47% APY and has no monthly service fee. TotalBank also doesn't have any other products, so it also not the best choice if you'd like to primarily bank with one financial institution. If you want to open other bank accounts — like checking accounts or savings account — or get other banking products — like loans or credit cards — consider one of our other top picks. Barclays Bank is one of the best banks for a high-yield savings account right now. Barclays Tiered Savings pays 4.15% to 4.40% APY, well above the national average. Your interest earnings will depend on your account balance. Barclays also offers some of the best CD rates for a $0 minimum opening deposit. Barclays does not have a checking account, so if this is a must for you, consider a different bank. To choose the right bank, you have to know what you want. Are you looking to open one specific bank account or do you plan to get multiple bank accounts or products? Do you prefer going to a branch and getting assistance from a banker, or would you rather use your mobile phone and computer to primarily manage your account? Are there certain principles or values you align with? Like, you might consider banking with awomen-ledor minority-owned bank if you are interested in these specific types of financial institutions. Also, if you are currently unbanked because you don't have a U.S. ID, know that you have options. Thetop banks for immigrants and non-U.S. Citizensallow you to provide a foreign passport or Matricula Consular to open a bank account. To help you narrow down your options, we've outlined specific features to look for in a top bank, depending on what you want out of your banking experience. (And if you're particularly looking for women-owned banks,Black-owned banks, orHispanic-American-owned banks, we have lists of those, too.) The top banks for savings accounts pay competitive interest rates. The average savings account interest rate is 0.41% APY, but many banks have high-yield savings accounts which have a significantly higher APY than the national average. The top rates you can find are5% interest savings accounts. Small banks have higher savings rates than national brands, but as you can see from our top pick Synchrony, you'll still benefit from a great interest rate regardless of whether choose a national or local institution. You should out look out formonthly bank maintenance fees, excess transaction fees, paper statement fees, and inactivity fees. Many banks waive these fees if you meet certain criteria, and some don't charge these fees at all. The best financial institutions for checking accounts make it easy to access your money. You should have access to a robust ATM network. If you like in-person banking, you should look for a bank with branches nearby. If you like online banking, you should find a bank that accepts cash deposits or offers a strong mobile app so you can manage your account digitally. A good bank for checking accounts will also help you avoidcommon bank fees, like monthly services fees, overdraft fees, and out-of-network ATM fees. You can also find specialty checking accounts that offer additional perks like cash bonuses for new customers, interest, or cash-back debit cards. To find the banks with the best customer service, we used information collected by the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. National Banking Satisfaction Study. The study gathered responses from nearly 11,000 banking customers from July to October 2024. It found that Capital One, Chase, and TD Bank were ranked highest in overall customer satisfaction. If you're also looking for banks that have extended customer service hours, abank with 24/7 customer supportcould also be a good fit. It may also help to check abank holiday schedule, so you know if a particular financial institution may be open on certain holidays when others aren't. Online banks often do not have any physical locations, but the top banks offer strong mobile and online banking so you won't miss out on going to a branch because you'll have convenient digital access to your accounts. The best banks for online-only experience havefree checking accountsand savings accounts, meaning that they don't charge any monthly service fees. Many of these top banks also won't charge any overdraft fees. The best brick-and-mortar banks stand out for their robust account options and services. They'll havedifferent types of checking accountsand savings accounts to choose from, as well as home loans, credit cards, personal loans, and more so you can build your banking experience over time. These banks often also offer relationship banking, which means that you'll get perks like discounts or waived account fees for having multiple products at the bank. Brick-and-mortar banks usually charge monthly service fees and overdraft fees on their bank accounts, but the top options will give you multiple ways to waive these fees. For example, you might be able to waive fees on a checking account by maintaining a certain amount of money in your account daily or setting up a certain amount in direct deposits per month. To waive overdraft fees, you'll be able to link your checking account to a savings account, or apply for a line of credit. Fees may apply for overdraft protection, but it'll be significantly less than paying overdraft fees. The biggest difference between online banks and traditional banks is that traditional banks have physical branches, while online banks typically don't. Since online banks have fewer overhead costs, their bank accounts tend to have fewer bank fees than ones from traditional banks. You'll also find savings accounts with higher interest rates at online banks. Brick-and-mortar banks tend to have a greater variety of bank accounts and services than online banks, though. For example, brick-and-mortar banks are more likely toexchange foreign currency, or offer more CD term lengths. Choosing between a traditional and online bank depends entirely on your preferences. Many national online banks have bank accounts with no monthly service fees and no overdraft fees, but you have to be OK with managing your account digitally. If you rely on a branch experience to manage your bank accounts, you might find a traditional bank is better suited for your needs. That said, if you go with a traditional bank just make sure you find bank accounts where you can waive potential bank fees. If you're ready to switch to a new bank, the first thing you have to do is find a new bank that's a better fit for your needs. Make sure the bank has all the accounts and services you want, and review fees to make sure that you can avoid them entirely. Once you've settled on a bank, you can open an account at a branch, online, or by phone. Banks verify your identity whenever you're applying for a bank account, so you'll need to provide your Social Security number and a government-issued ID. You canclose your old bank accountonce your new bank account is approved and open. To set up a direct deposit to your new account, you'll have to update your account information with your employer. The same goes for any bills that you have set up with autopay — you'll have to update your information with the company that issues the bill. We review the ethics of each company so you can see if a specific financial institution aligns with your values. We also include the settlement history of the last three years, so you're aware of any recent public controversies involving the bank. The Better Business Bureau grades companies by looking at responses to customer complaints, advertising, and transparency about business practices. A strong BBB grade doesn't guarantee you'll have a smooth experience with a bank. You may also want to read online reviews or look into public scandals. We've also detailed any existing public issues with each bank. TD Bank has aD+ ratingbecause government action has been taken against the bank. The U.S. Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection said TD Bankhad been breaking the lawby charging customers for its Debit Card Advance service without their permission. In 2023, JP Morgan Chase was also required to pay$75 million in a settlementwith the U.S. Virgin Islands that accused the financial institution of failing to report suspicious activity regarding Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation. Synchrony currently has anNR ratingbecause the bank is in the process of responding to previously closed complaints. TotalBank has anA- ratingfrom the BBB because it hasn't responded to one customer complaint. Synchrony has been involved in a few public controversies. In 2023, Synchrony was required to pay$2.6 million in a settlementwhen accused of calling customers about bank accounts they didn't have. In 2024, Discover was required to pay$1 millionin a settlement that claimed Discover denied Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, recipients loans because of their immigration status. In the settlement, Discover agreed to rewrite its lending rules to make DACA recipients equally eligible for loans as comparable U.S. citizens. In 2022,Barclays paid $361 million in a settlementwith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC claimed the bank distributed a high number of unregistered securities and didn't thoroughly keep track of security sales. Although Barclays settled, the bank neither confirmed nor denied these charges. The best banks for savings accounts tend to be online banks or banks with no-fee high-yield savings accounts. You should use an online bank if you're looking for low fees and the highest APYs. Because online banks don't pay for physical branch locations, they can charge less and pay more. However, physical banks are better for anyone who needs to deposit cash regularly. Online banks usually have the lowest fees for checking accounts, but keep in mind that most do not have any physical branches. If you value banking in-person, you can find checking accounts that waive typical bank fees in several ways. To choose the best bank, think about which type of financial institution you want to bank with: a traditional, an online bank, acredit union, or a non-traditional banking platform. If you're looking for a bank account, look at various options from different financial institutions and compare fees, interests rates, opening requirements, and any other perks. It's also beneficial to think about your overall banking experience and whether you might be interested in other accounts or services in the future. The No. 1 bank in America is Chase, if you go by the highest number of locations. Many locations makes it good for getting easy access to your money and regular customer service. Chase also has a high score from the Better Business Bureau. The bank with the most complaints may be Citibank. Unlike other major banks, it is not accredited by the Better Business Bureau and received a score of F. To learn more about what makes a good bank and how to choose the best fit, four experts weighed in: We're focusing on what will make a bank most useful, including fees, interest rates, accessibility, and more. Here's what they had to say about banking online. (Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.) How can someone determine whether a bank is the right fit for them? Tania Brown, CFP® professional and vice president of coaching strategy atOfColor: ""Obviously, you want to make sure it's FDIC insured. Also, your banking experience — do you like walking into a bank? Well, then you need someone local. Do you just not care if you ever see your bank? Then you're okay online. Do you write checks? Do you not write checks? So it's thinking through how your experience with it is going to be before you make that decision."" Sophia Acevedo, banking editor,Business Insider: ""I would create a list of what I prioritize most in a bank account. For example, some banks have accounts that charge monthly service fees. I would look to see what the requirements are for waiving the monthly service fee and whether I think I could feasibly meet those requirements each month. If I'm searching for an interest-earning bank account I'll pay attention to interest rates. I would make sure the account pays a higher interest rate than theaverage bank account."" What should someone look for in a brick-and-mortar bank? ""How can that bank grow with you? If you are 25, single or newly married, and all you need is a checking account, that's going to look very different 15 years from now when you may have had a couple of jobs, you may have an IRA roll over, or you may want a financial adviser."" Mykail James, MBA, certified financial education instructor,BoujieBudgets.com: ""How accessible it is. So where are the branches? And if I am to go out of town or something, how accessible is my money to me?"" ""With a brick-and-mortar bank, I would review all the bank accounts and make sure there are options where I can waive monthly service fees. I would also factor in the overall banking experience. For example, I would see if a bank lets you exchange foreign currency — not all do — and has a strong mobile app."" What should someone look for in an online bank? Roger Ma, CFP® professional and author of""Work Your Money, Not Your Life"": ""How onerous the transfer process is, transferring money in and transferring money out. Is it same day, next day? Is it pretty easy to sync a brick-and-mortar checking account to this particular high-yield savings account?"" ""When it comes to online banks, you want to be a little bit more strict about what type of interest rates they're providing. That's the biggest thing, because online banks are supposed to have the higher interest rate because they don't have the overhead of the brick-and-mortar. You want to make sure that it's well above the national average. ""What types of securities do they provide? Do they have two-factor identification? If it's an online bank, they should definitely have — at the bare minimum — two-factor authentication in how easy it is to change your passwords and things like that, because you want to be a little more hypersensitive about the cyber security for a strictly online bank."" Our Methodology: How We Chose the Best Banks Business Insider's personal finance team looked at over 200 financial institutions to find the best banks offer a wide range of products and effective customer service. Business Insider's personal finance team is editorially independent and we haveeditorial standardswe follow for rating and reviewing products. Being editorially independent means our business team does not decide how we cover products and what we write about. Banks should make it easy to access your money. With a brick-and-mortar bank, we looked at banks with large branch and ATM networks. Although most online banks don't have physical branches, we chose ones with plenty of ATMs nationwide. A bank should also make it affordable to keep your money with the institution. We chose online banks that pay high rates and charge low fees, or no fees at all. Brick-and-mortar banks are known for paying lower rates and charging higher fees, but a good one should make it possible to waive monthly fees. We also looked at other types of charges, such as fees for overdrafts, using out-of-network ATMs, and foreign transactions. We rate bank products on a scale from one to five stars. If a checking account has a rating of one star, it means the bank account requires significant improvement. It's also the lowest possible rating. If a checking account has five stars, it's considered a superior option. That's the highest rating possible. See ourbank account rating methodologyto learn more about how we rate bank accounts. We score various features on a scale of zero to five. Then, calculate the weighted average to get an account's final rating, which means we weigh certain features, like interest rates and fees, at a higher weight percentage than others. We understand that these areas can more heavily impact a person's overall banking experience.

UFB Portfolio Money Markethas a $10 monthly service fee that's waivable if you keep at least $5,000 in your account.

Credit Monitoring,"Credit monitoring services notify you of changes in your credit report. Some monitoring services will provide additional services, including VPNs or identity theft insurance. Because of this, the best credit monitoring services somewhat overlap with the best identity theft protection services. The best credit monitoring services will also offer security and recovery tools to help you avoid trouble and real-time alerts so you can address anything promptly when it arises. Below is our selection of the credit monitoring companies and what you can expect from each. The prices listed are the standard rates advertised when writing, but you can likely find discounts through referrals or other promotional codes where applicable. Most monitoring services also offer a free trial, so you can test them before buying. Featured Credit Monitoring and Fraud Protection Companies CreditWise is a free credit monitoring service from Capital One. You don't have to be a Capital One account holder to use it, but you can access CreditWise from within the Capital One app, so it's convenient if you already have a Capital One account or a Capital One credit card. Here's our guide to thebest Capital One credit cards. Like Credit Karma, CreditWise monitors data from two of the three major credit reporting agencies (TransUnion and Experian, in this case). While you'll get alerts about changes to both files, you'll only be able to access data from TransUnion. CreditWise won't show you details of your Experian file. That makes CreditWise less attractive if keeping an eye on all your credit reports is a priority. On the positive side, CreditWise is slightly easier to use than Credit Karma, as it presents the most vital data concisely and upfront without subjecting users to ads. It's a great tool if you'd prefer to use a single service and don't have a pressing need for more thorough credit monitoring or identity theft protection services. Cost:$29.95 monthly or $299.50 annually IdentityForce UltraSecure+Credit is a product of TransUnion, but the +Credit plan also monitors Experian and Equifax reports. On top of credit monitoring, Ultra Secure+Credit offers broader protection of social media accounts, banking and investment accounts, mobile device scanning, and dark web data analysis. That additional scrutiny increases the odds of detecting suspicious activity and credit-related fraud, making it a good fit for anyone whose personal information has already been compromised. Ultra Secure+Credit goes beyond detection by offering a variety of security tools to help prevent identity theft from occurring in the first place. It provides cybersecurity tools, including anti-virus and malware protection, a virtual private network (VPN) for safe browsing, password management software, and an online vault for storing sensitive digital documents. IdentityForce also offers a 30-day free trial, annual discounts, and family plans. If you're dissatisfied with IdentityForce, you can cancel and receive a prorated refund for unused services. Cost:$15 monthly or $144 annually Aura All-In-One provides fewer monitoring services than IdentityForce. It doesn't include social media, for one, but it offers well-rounded protection with monitoring and real-time alerts for all three credit bureaus. You'll also get a similar array of security tools, as well as email aliases, to reduce spam and exposure to data breaches. Aura All-In-One shines brightest with its couple and family plans, which provide the same protections for additional members at a heavily discounted cost per person. Aura All-In-One family plan also offers parental controls for mobile and other devices. Most of the services included on this list will give you some form of identity theft protection in addition to credit monitoring. PrivacyGuard separates its credit monitoring and identity theft protection services (included on our list of the best identity theft protection services) into two different plans, merging both services in its PrivacyGuard Total Protection. While no identity theft protection is a major loss, especially at its relatively high price tag, PrivacyGuard still offers fraud resolution for its credit monitoring customers. However, the reason we've included PrivacyGuard Credit Protection is for its credit-building resources. Credit monitoring is useful for detecting identity theft, but it's also a great tool to use when you're trying to improve your credit scores. This is where PrivacyGuard shines. In addition to a credit information hotline, PrivacyGuard also has a credit score simulator, which will give you a rough estimate of how newlines of creditwill affect your credit score. Credit Karma andExperian Free Credit Reportare separate services, both available for free. Neither one reports from all three major credit bureaus — Credit Karma monitors TransUnion and Equifax, while Experian naturally offers data from its own reports — but together, they cover all the bases. Unfortunately, when something is free, you're the product. These credit monitoring services are no exception. You'll have to sift through marketing material for credit cards, loans, or insurance offers, along with invitations to upgrade to a paid service (in the case ofExperian Free Credit Report). Once you look past the ads, you'll see a detailed look at all the factors that go into your credit score calculation, including account balances, credit utilization, payment histories, average age of credit accounts, recenthard inquiries, and records of any derogatory marks. Experian also lets you add rent payments and utilities to your credit report throughExperian Boost. These services allow you to dispute any inaccurate information directly through the platform. While you get to dispute errors directly with Experian through their service, Credit Karma offers very basic credit repair services,disputing your credit reporton your behalf. Both services offer email and push notifications for various events, including data breaches or potentialidentity theft, changes to your credit report, and even reminders to pay bills. Both services also have highly rated mobile apps, which sets them apart from most apps offered by specialized identity theft protection services. That's a big plus if you prefer to monitor your credit on a mobile device. Lastly, these services will also show you credit products you are likely to qualify for with your credit profile, which may be helpful if you're in the market for a new credit card. You can read our full guide to thebest credit cards. A credit monitoring service by itself is a car's dashboard indicator: It can detect and warn you about potential problems, but it won't solve them. The onus is still on you to respond, and much like a flat tire or low oil pressure, ignoring the warning will likely make things worse. These varying levels of protection come at similarly varying prices. Free services typically offer limited monitoring capability from only one or two of the three major credit bureaus, while high-end services package credit monitoring with identity theft protection and data security tools for a monthly premium. Prices for high-end credit monitoring and identity protection can range from $20 to $35. The best credit monitoring solution is the one that meets your needs at a price you can afford. The free options listed will suffice if you only want an extra eye on your credit report and score while youbuild credit. The paid options offer additional services for people who are concerned about identity theft. Monitoring one or two bureaus is better than no monitoring, so the option you choose doesn't have to be absolutely perfect. For thorough credit monitoring, look for services that offer reporting from all three major credit bureaus. Many basic plans only monitor a single bureau, leaving room for inaccuracies to slip through unnoticed on your other credit reports. Depending on where you are in your credit journey, it may also be helpful to look for a credit monitoring service that provides educational resources on where to improve your credit profile and factors that are dragging down yourcredit score calculations. Finally, look for a service you'll actually use. Maybe a service you already use offers credit monitoring, so you'll be more likely to glance at your credit reports. If a service inspires you to be more proactive about monitoring your credit, that's a strong selling point. Your decision can even come down to something as simple as how the dashboard looks or how well the app works. Monitoring your credit is a solid financial practice akin tobalancing your checkbookand examining credit card statements. As shown with some of our top choices above, you can do it effectively at no cost. Free services like Credit Karma and CreditWise provide the information you need to detect something amiss on your credit file, so long as you're paying attention. You may also be able to pick up credit monitoring features with other credit-related subscriptions. Some of thebest rent reporting servicesand thebest credit builder loansoffer credit monitoring as a side feature, so you can track your progress. Regardless of where you get free credit monitoring, it should suffice if you have no acute concerns about the security of your personal information. Paying for credit monitoring (along with additional monitoring and identity theft protection) is an easier sell if your data has been compromised before. The odds of illicit activity on your credit file are higher in that case, so the cost of more comprehensive protection is easier to justify. A paid credit monitoring service may be worth it if you want protection and monitoring for your entire family, including children. Digging into an adult's credit report can be annoying, but monitoring your child's credit is even more so. However, the process is necessary to catchchild identity theftearly. To access a child's credit report, parents or guardians must submit a request by mail with documents proving their child's identity, their identity, and their relation to the child. If this isn't something you're willing to do regularly, signing up for a credit monitoring service with a family plan can cut the amount of work you have to do. If you're unsure what level of protection you want, start with a free service to get acquainted with your credit report and see whether it suits your monitoring needs. If you find the free services lacking, you can always upgrade. You can also check to see if a credit monitoring service offers a refund. Credit monitoring involves regularly checking your credit files for changes, inaccuracies, or suspicious activity. While you can do this yourself, credit monitoring services can automate this process. They alert you of changes on your credit profile, such as new credit inquiries, open or closed accounts, increasing or decreasing balances, and potential identity theft. Credit monitoring services also give you access to information on your credit accounts, allowing you tocheck your credit scoreover time and view yourcredit utilization ratio. These can be helpful if you're building credit and need to keep track of your progress. Yourcredit scoreis a prominent factor in your financial profile. Good credit makes it easier to qualify for loans and secure low interest rates, so it pays to improve your score. Keeping tabs on your credit reports will help you track your progress and protect you from bad actors looking to steal your identity and use your credit. Yes, it is safe to use credit monitoring services. Reputable services use encryption and follow strict privacy standards to protect your personal information, but always research and select a service with a strong track record of security and customer satisfaction. Yes, you may need a credit monitoring service if you regularly check your credit report. Credit monitoring services offer real-time alerts and additional protection against identity theft, providing a more comprehensive security approach. Yes, free credit monitoring services can be effective by providing basic monitoring and alerts. However, paid services often offer more extensive protection and options, including identity theft insurance and access to all three credit bureau reports. Credit monitoring services can provide insight into factors affecting your credit score, alert you to potential inaccuracies on your credit report and fraud, and provide tools for credit improvement. Choosing the best credit monitoring services comes down to what you get for the money you're paying. A paid service at its highest tier needs to monitor your reports from all three of themajor credit bureaus— Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. On the other hand, while free credit monitoring services offer less than paid services, it is very hard to argue with free. In the worst-case scenario, these services fill your inbox with excessive emails. This cost is a small one to pay for free credit monitoring. However, you should be aware of the limitations and blind spots of monitoring one bureau instead of all three. The best credit monitoring services also have aspects of identity theft protection included in their features, like public records or dark web monitoring. These two services are hard to replicate on your own. They should also provide some identity theft recovery assistance. Ideally, this means an in-house expert dedicated to your specific case to help yourecover from identity theft. However, at the very least, a service should provide stolen wallet protection or identity theft insurance.

Best Credit Cards,"I think about credit cards all the time. As a personal finance journalist, I've covered credit card rewards for a decade and have more than three dozen active cards. My family and friends frequently ask me, ""What's the best credit card?"" and ""What credit card should I get?"" Here are the top credit cards that I recommend. Why I recommend the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card:I recommended the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card to my whole family because it offers a generous welcome bonus and some of the best travel insurance available from a credit card — especially one with such a low annual fee of just $95. Topping Business Insider's list ofbest travel credit cardsfor beginners and experts alike, this card offers newcomers a nice stash ofChase Ultimate Rewards®points — you can earn 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening. The points from this welcome offer are worth at least $750 toward travel booked through Chase. You can get even higher value — up to $1,080 or more by Business Insider's valuations — if you redeem your rewards throughChase transfer partners. Cardholders like my mom earn 5 points per dollar on travel throughChase Travel℠ and 2 points per dollar on all other travel purchases. My mom also earns 5 points per dollar on Lyft rides through March 2025; 3 points on dining, online grocery purchases, and select streaming services; and 1 point per dollar on other purchases. Mom can also transfer Chase points to airline and hotel companies such as British Airways, Hyatt, United Airlines, and Southwest. When she books travel directly through Chase, her points are worth 1.25 cents apiece — a 25% bonus over their redemption value elsewhere. Beyond the rewards, I feel good about my mom using the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card because it offers some of the best complimentary travel insurance of any credit card. She gets primary car rental insurance whenever she rents a car and declines purchasing coverage through the rental agency. This means she can file a claim with Chase if her rental gets damaged or stolen instead of filing through her personal car insurance policy, which can increase her premiums. As a cardholder, my mom is also eligible for trip delay insurance and baggage delay insurance through her Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card benefits. So if her flight is delayed past a certain amount of time or the airline loses her checked bag, she can get reimbursed for basic necessities such as a new toothbrush, change of clothes, or other reasonable replacement items. Finally, the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card comes with a 10% anniversary points bonus, and up to $50 a year in statement credits for hotels booked through Chase. What I love:Primary rental car insurance, generous travel credit, easy rewards Earn 5 points on travel purchased through Chase Travel℠. Earn 3 points on dining, select streaming services and online groceries. Earn 2 points on all other travel purchases. Earn 1 points on all other purchases. If you're new to travel rewards credit cards or just don't want to pay hundreds in annual fees, the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card is a smart choice. It earns bonus points on a wide variety of travel and dining purchases and offers strong travel and purchase coverage, including primary car rental insurance. Why I Didn't Recommend the Chase Sapphire Reserve® or The Platinum Card® from American Express The Chase Sapphire Reserve® and The Platinum Card® from American Express are two of the best-known travel rewards cards in the world. However, both charge sky-high annual fees even if their benefits are worth far more. While airport lounge access is a dream for anyone, I often tell infrequent travelers to save some money by getting a card with a much lower annual fee and paying for lounge day passes as needed. If you find yourself buying more than two lounge passes each year, it might be time to consider an upgrade. Why I recommend the Chase Freedom Unlimited®:The Chase Freedom Unlimited® is a top pick from my list of thebest no-annual-fee credit cards, and it's particularly attractive since I have other credit cards that earn Chase Ultimate Rewards®. My Chase Freedom Unlimited® earns 5% cash back onChase Travel℠ and Lyft purchases, similar to the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card. It also earns 3% cash back on dining and drugstore purchases, and a flat 1.5% cash back on everything else. While this card is technically a cash-back credit card, I can transfer rewards from my Chase Freedom Unlimited® to my Chase Sapphire Reserve® credit card to use for business-class award flights or through Chase Travel℠ for a 50% value bonus. It also comes with a generous introductory offer: 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for the first 15 months, then 19.49% - 28.24% Variable APR. This zero-interest period has been helpful when I make large purchases I plan to pay off over time. Unfortunately, this card chargesforeign transaction fees, and I've paid more than I should whenever I accidentally use this card while traveling internationally. What I love:Great earning rates, no annual fee, and initial zero-interest period What I don't love:Foreign transaction fees Earn 5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Travel℠; 3% cash back on drugstore purchases and dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery service, and 1.5% on all other purchases 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for the first 15 months Earn an additional 1.5% cash back on everything you buy The Chase Freedom Unlimited® is a great choice for credit card beginners and experts alike. With no annual fee and a high earnings rate, it's worth considering as an everyday card — and it's even better when you pair it with an annual-fee Chase card like the Chase Sapphire Reserve®. Why I Didn't Recommend the Chase Freedom Flex® I spent a long time deliberating between the Chase Freedom Unlimited® and the Chase Freedom Flex® for this category. After all, both cards offer nearly identical benefits, and have similar reward rates and bonus categories. I have both cards, and actually utilize my Chase Freedom Flex® more often than my Chase Freedom Unlimited®. But the Chase Freedom Flex® is best for people who don't mind spending extra time and energy tracking 5%quarterly bonus categories— it's not as easy to maximize as the Chase Freedom Unlimited®. For the purposes of this guide, I highlighted credit cards that make your life easier, and the Chase Freedom Unlimited® is simpler thanks to its flat 1.5% cash back on most purchases. If you like the thrill of the cash-back chase like I do, the Chase Freedom Flex® might be right for you. Read more about this card in ourChase Freedom Flex credit card review. Like its cousin, this option also pairs well with other Chase cards that earn Chase Ultimate Rewards®. Why I recommend the Bilt Mastercard®:The Bilt Mastercard® is best known as a great credit card for people who pay rent. Renters canpay rent with this credit cardwithout incurring any transaction fees, and they even earn Bilt Points for doing so — on up to 100,000 points each calendar year. But even non-renters like myself earn great rewards with this credit card. I got the Bilt Mastercard® because it earns 3 points per dollar on dining, 2 points on travel, and 1 point on most other purchases. (However, I have to make at least five purchases each billing cycle to earn rewards on this card.) Fortunately, it's easy to use this card at least five times a month. I earn double points on the first day of every month, affectionately known as ""Bilt Rent Day"", on up to 1,000 points. I can also earn bonuses on Bilt Rent Day by playing trivia games and participating in various contests. Double points don't apply to rent payments but do stack with other rewards such as bonus points on Bilt Dining. For example, I can earn 9 points per dollar on Bilt Rent Day if I go to a Bilt Neighborhood restaurant that earns 3 points per dollar spent and pay with my Bilt Mastercard®: Pro tip:You don't have to be a Bilt cardholder to earnBilt Points. Simply link any credit card to the Bilt app wallet to earn points on all eligible dining purchases. Bilt Points have an average worth of 1.65 cents apiece, based on Business Insider's valuations. But they're even more valuable when transferred to travel partners like Alaska Airlines, which doesn't accepttransferrable points from any other credit card. I can also book travel directly through the Bilt Rewards travel portal at a rate of 1.25 cents per point. The Bilt Mastercard® also comes with generous benefits including primary rental car insurance, trip delay insurance that goes into effect after six hours,cell phone protectionof up to $800 per claim which is subject to a $25 deductible, and no foreign transaction fees (rates and fees). What I love:Double point days and generous dining rewards with no annual fee What I don't love:Bilt Rent Day rewards are capped at a 1,000-point maximum Read ourBilt Mastercard card reviewto learn more about this card. Why I recommend the Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card:The Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card earns a flat 2% cash rewards rate on purchases, and comes with a generous welcome bonus for a no-annual-fee card: $200 cash rewards bonus after spending $500 in purchases in the first three months from account opening. I recommend this card to anyone who's been considering one of thebest cash-back credit cards(or thebest Wells Fargo credit cards) because it's just so easy to use. With the Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card, you'll never have to track which categories earn bonus points because everything earns 2% back — no more, no less.  You can redeemWells Fargo Rewardsfor statement credits, gift cards, travel, and more. I always appreciate a good zero-interest period, and this card delivers with a 0% intro APR on purchases and qualifying balance transfers for 12 months from account opening, followed by a 19.24%, 24.24%, or 29.24% variable APR. The Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card also comes with a wide range of benefits, including cell phone protection for up to $600 per claim. This card does charge foreign transaction fees, so leave it at home on international trips. What I love:Flat-rate 2% cash rewards and 0% intro APR with no annual fee What I don't love:Foreign transaction fees Earn unlimited 2% cash rewards on purchases. 0% intro APR on purchases and qualifying balance transfers for 12 months from account opening 19.24%, 24.24%, or 29.24% variable The Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card is definitely worth considering if you want to earn a strong rate of cash rewards on purchases without rotating categories or earning caps and with no annual fee. It's got a solid welcome bonus and intro APR offer, which puts it high on our list of the best zero-interest credit cards. Why I Didn't Recommend the Citi® Double Cash Card It's always challenging to decide which top credit card deserves what accolade. The Citi® Double Cash Card also appears in this guide later on, as our top pick for a good balance transfer credit card. The primary difference between these two cards is that the Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card offers a shorter 0% intro APR period that applies to both purchases and balance transfers, while the Citi® Double Cash Card has a longer period of zero interest that only applies to balance transfers. Why I recommend the Discover it® Cash Back:The Discover it® Cash Back is one of my newest cards, and I got it because I wanted a no-annual-fee credit card offering generous 0% intro APR terms that still earns rewards. This card offers a longer-than-usual zero-interest period: 0% intro APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers, then 18.24% - 27.24% Variable APR APR. While some cards offer longer periods with zero interest, few do so while still earning rewards as generous as the Discover it® Cash Back offers. The Discover it® Cash Back makes earning rewards extra fun, with quarterly bonus categories that change every three months (from January 1 to March 31, 2025, earn 5% cash back at restaurants, home improvement stores, and select streaming services on up to $1,500 in purchases after enrollment, then 1%). I use ourDiscover cash back calendarto help me track 5% bonus categories. This card doesn't earn a traditional welcome bonus, but Discover will automatically match all the cash back you've earned at the end of your first year for new card members. Pro tip:If you're a student, there's a version of this card that's designed just for you. Read more about the Discover it® Student Cash Back in ourDiscover it Student Cash Back card review. What I love:Generous 0% intro APR period and bonus reward categories and double cash back in my first year What I don't love:1% flat rate on non-bonus categories Earn 5% cash back on everyday purchases at different places you shop each quarter like grocery stores, restaurants, gas stations, and more, up to the quarterly maximum when you activate. Earn unlimited 1% cash back on all other purchases automatically. 0% intro APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers The Discover it® Cash Back is one of the best credit cards that offers 5% back on popular rotating categories up to a spending limit. Your rewards are matched by Discover after the first 12 months, and the card has no annual fee. Why I Didn't Recommend the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card The Wells Fargo Reflect® Card was our previous pick for this credit card category, and it offers one of the longest 0% intro APR periods we've ever seen: 0% intro APR for 21 months from account opening on purchases and qualifying balance transfers made within 120 days, followed by a 17.24%, 23.74%, or 28.99% Variable APR. However, the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card doesn't earn any rewards, while the Discover it® Cash Back offers generous returns on certain categories. While our recommended card has a slightly shorter 0% APR period, it offers cardholders better returns in the long run and more long-term value. Why I recommend the Citi® Double Cash Card:I spent a lot of time trying to decide between the Citi® Double Cash Card and the Discover it® Cash Back, because both offer great benefits and very similar rewards. Ultimately, I think the Citi® Double Cash Card is best for people who want to make a balance transfer because it offers 0% intro APR on balance transfers for 18 months, then 18.24% - 28.24% Variable APR. Cardholders do have to pay a 3% intro fee of each transfer ($5 minimum) completed within the first four months of account opening, then 5% of each transfer ($5 minimum). But the balance transfer fee is significantly lower than what you'd pay in credit card interest anywhere else. As the name suggests, the Citi® Double Cash Card also earns great rewards, which can be rare on credit cards with such a long zero-interest period. You'll earn 2% cash back on all purchases: 1% cash back when you make a purchase, and another 1% cash back when you pay off what you owe. Rewards aren't capped, which is why this card also ranks on our list of thebest 2% cash back credit cards. What I love:Super-long 0% intro APR period for balance transfers with no annual fee What I don't love:No 0% intro APR for purchases Learn more about this card in ourCiti Double Cash card review. Why I Didn't Recommend the Citi Simplicity® Card The Citi Simplicity® Card is a sister card of the Citi® Double Cash Card with an even longer zero-interest period for balance transfers: 0% intro APR on balance transfers for 21 months (transfers must be completed within four months of account opening) and on purchases for 12 months, then 18.24% - 28.99% Variable APR. However, the Citi Simplicity® Card doesn't earn any rewards, and I will always choose the option of earning 2% cash back over three extra months of no interest. If you just want the longer option for a zero-interest balance transfer, read more about this card in ourCiti Simplicity card review. Why I recommend the Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express:The Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express is a fantastic household credit card. This card earns 6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets on up to $6,000 per year in purchases (then 1%) and on select U.S. streaming subscriptions, 3% cash back at U.S. gas stations and on transit (including taxis, rideshare, parking, tolls, trains, buses and more), and 1% cash back on other purchases (cash back is received in the form of Reward Dollars that can be redeemed as a statement credit or at Amazon.com checkout). Terms apply. There are several caveats, of course: The Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express is one of the few cards on this list with an annual fee after Year 1: $0 intro for the first year, then $95 (rates and fees). But if you max out the $6,000 at U.S. supermarkets bonus each year, that's $360 of cash in your pocket — significantly more than the annual fee you'll start paying in Year 2. What I love:6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets (up to $6,000 per year) and select streaming subscriptions, 3% back at U.S. gas stations and transit expenses. Terms apply. What I don't love:Annual fee after the first year Earn 6% Cash Back at U.S. supermarkets on up to $6,000 per year in purchases (then 1%). Earn 6% Cash Back on select U.S. streaming subscriptions. Earn 3% Cash Back at U.S. gas stations. Earn 3% Cash Back on transit (including taxis, rideshare, parking, tolls, trains, buses and more). Earn 1% Cash Back on other purchases. Cash Back is received in the form of Reward Dollars that can be redeemed as a statement credit or at Amazon.com checkout. $0 intro for the first year, then $95 0% intro APR for 12 months on purchases and balance transfers from the date of account opening The Amex Blue Cash Preferred is one of the best cash-back cards, particularly for consumers who spend a lot of money at U.S. supermarkets, use streaming services, or have lots of commuting and gas expenses. The annual fee is worth it if your typical spending lines up with the card's bonus categories. Why I Didn't Recommend the American Express® Gold Card The American Express® Gold Card is one of the most popular credit cards for foodies, earning 4Amex pointsper dollar on both groceries at U.S. supermarkets (on up to $25,000 in purchases) and restaurants worldwide (on up to $50,000 in purchases)(terms apply). However, I think the card's $325 annual fee is too steep for me to recommend it for most people, especially those who are just getting started withrewards credit cards. But if you're a big foodie, read more about this card's pros and cons in ourreview of the Amex Gold Card. Why I recommend the Southwest Rapid Rewards® Priority Credit Card:Southwest is one of the most popular airlines for U.S. travelers, and the Southwest Rapid Rewards® Priority Credit Card gives cardholders a serious leg up on benefits. This credit card is Southwest's premium consumer card and comes with a $149 annual fee. But cardholders get an annual credit of $75 toward Southwest flights, which effectively halves the out-of-pocket cost of the annual fee. Cardholders also earn generous anniversary bonuses, four upgraded boardings per year, a nice welcome offer, bonus points on Southwest flights and several other spend categories, and avoid foreign transaction fees. Southwest will begin charging for seat assignments in late 2025. And while we don't know many details about this momentous change, cardholders will likely get exclusive benefits that everyday travelers do not. If nothing else, Southwest Rapid Rewards® Priority Credit Cardholders will earn 3 points per dollar when paying for preferred seating. The Southwest Rapid Rewards® Priority Credit Card won't do you any good if you don't fly Southwest, of course. But if you do, this card can help you fast-track your way to elite status and the covetedSouthwest Companion Pass, especially if you time your welcome offer just right. What I love:$75 annual statement credit toward Southwest travel Earn 3 points per dollar on Southwest® purchases. Earn 2 points per dollar on Rapid Rewards hotel and car rental partner purchases. Earn 2 points per dollar on local transit and commuting, including rideshare. Earn 2 points per dollar on internet, cable, and phone services, and select streaming. Earn 1 point per dollar spent on all other purchases. Earn Companion Pass® plus 30,000 points If you can make use of the Southwest Rapid Rewards® Priority Credit Card's many benefits and perks, it's well worth the annual fee. Otherwise, have a look at other Southwest cards like the Southwest Rapid Rewards® Plus Credit Card and Southwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Credit Card, which have lower annual fees but the same elevated welcome bonus offer. Why I Didn't Recommend Other Airline Credit Cards Airline credit cardsrarely offer the best value when used for every purchase. In fact, many savvy travelers use airline credit cards exclusively for the carrier-specific benefits they offer, such as free checked bags and preferred seating. We previously recommended the Delta SkyMiles® Platinum American Express Card as the best airline credit card for most travelers. However, an annual fee increase in 2024 made me reconsider whether it offers the best value for most of my friends and family. People often tell me that Delta is their preferred airline. But it isn't always the most affordable carrier, whether you pay with cash or Delta SkyMiles. And in most cases, cardholders still earn more and get better travel insurance protection by using a travel rewards credit card with excellent benefits such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card. Learn more about airline credit card pros and cons in our guide to thebest airline credit cards. Why I think the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card is worth getting:You might wonder why my pick for thebest hotel credit cardhas an annual fee of $550. That's a steep price to pay upfront, but savvy Hilton guests can whiz their way to top-brass elite status with this credit card. I had this credit card for many years and only gave it up because I transferred my loyalty to another hotel chain. Most premium hotel credit cards offer generous elite status that still requires a certain amount of spend to get to the very top. But the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card comes with automatic Diamond status — Hilton's very highest elite tier. You'll get late checkout, early check-in, free breakfast, and many other perks just by having this card (terms apply). The card also comes with a solid welcome bonus of 175,000 Hilton Honors bonus points after you spend $6,000 in purchases on the card within your first six months of card membership (offer ends 4/29/2025), plus an annual free night award you can use at almost any Hilton worldwide — including the aspirational Waldorf Astoria brand, where reservations routinely average $1,000 or more each night. Pro tip:Hilton recently forged a partnership with Small Luxury Hotels of the World, giving Hilton loyalists access to 600 new options. Cardholders get up to $400 in annual Hilton credit (in semi-annual increments of up to $200) toward room service, spa treatments, or activities, as well as up to $200 in airline incidental fee credits each year (up to $50 per quarter) toward any carrier of their choice (terms apply). What I love:Automatic top-tier Diamond elite status, annual free night certificate What I don't love:High annual fee and Hilton-specific benefits Learn more about this card in ourHilton Aspire card review. Why I Didn't Recommend a Marriott Credit Card or The World Of Hyatt Credit Card Marriott offers several great hotel credit cards, and I actually have three of them myself. However, I wouldn't miss any of the cards in my current arsenal, while I regularly think about the benefits I miss from my Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card even when compared to the top-tier Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant® American Express® Card. Marriott has one of the world's largest collection of hotels, so getting one of thebest Marriott credit cardsmight be a good option for you if you don't travel to destinations with many Hilton properties to choose from. If you prefer luxury and don't mind a smaller global footprint, you might consider Hyatt, which only offersThe World Of Hyatt Credit Card. I always say there isn't a magical ""best credit card"" that works for every person. Some people preferno-annual-fee credit cards, while others don't mind paying a hefty annual sum forpremium credit cards with airport lounge access. Some valuetravel rewards credit cards, while others prefer to focus oncash-back credit cards. If you're a foodie, you'll want to choose one of thebest credit cards for dining, restaurants, and foodin general. But if you're more of a homebody, you may want to focus on thebest credit cards for buying groceriesand thebest credit cards for gas purchases. If your credit score is lower than you'd like, you may qualify for some of thebest credit cards for bad creditor seek asecured credit card, which can help you build credit and even earn rewards while you work toward a stronger financial future. If you're a first-time credit card applicant or a student with minimal income, you may want to consider one of thebest starter credit cardsor thebest student credit cards. I compiled this list of the best credit cards for benefits, rewards, and financial protection you won't get from paying cash or using a debit card. It's impossible to name a single credit card that would be perfect for everyone's needs. But knowing what you want from your credit card can help you find your best option. I wrote this list for people like my parents, who just want to know what card they should use. Out of hundreds of credit cards on the market, these are the best options I've found. In fact, you'll find many of them in my own wallet. Choosing the best credit cards is a momentous task, and it's a responsibility I take very seriously. I regularly evaluate dozens of credit cards available to consumers and business owners, and update this guide on a monthly basis. In addition to considering my own perspective and consulting with industry colleagues, I read popular forums such as Reddit and FlyerTalk to see what everyday consumers are saying about different card as well. I evaluated each of the cards in this guide — and screened out many others — against the following criteria: Read Business Insider's guide to points and miles valuations to learn what your credit card rewards are worth, and learn more abouthow we rate credit cards. The best credit card will vary based on your individual needs and wants. The Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card is a fantastic card for people who travel, while most people can benefit from having a Chase Freedom Unlimited® in their wallet.Chase credit cardsas a whole are extremely popular with consumers. Some store credit cards are also very popular with consumers, including theBest Buy credit cardand theHome Depot credit card. The most publicly known premium card in the world is theCenturion ""Black Card"" by American Express. A cash rewards credit card with no annual fee is always good to have in your wallet, like the Chase Freedom Unlimited®. The Bilt Mastercard® allows you to pay rent on a credit card, and earns great travel rewards for no annual fee (rates and fees). If you're willing to pay an annual fee, the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card offers generous benefits and a strong travel rewards program.

In addition, new cardholders get a 0% intro APR on purchases and qualifying balance transfers for 12 months from account opening (followed by a 19.24%, 24.24%, or 29.24% variable APR).

They come in a few different types: If you're willing to juggle multiple credit cards, there's value in having both cash-back and points-earning cards. If you prefer a single-card strategy, evaluate your goals and consider how much you're willing to pay in annual fees to make the best decision for your situation. If you're trying to put money back in your wallet, our top recommendations are to transfer your cashback to a bank account or use it to reduce the amount owed on your credit card statement. On the other hand, if you're hoping to earn rewards that you can redeem for travel, a card that earns points is more up your alley. Many of thebest rewards credit cardsearnAmex points,Chase Ultimate Rewards points,Citi ThankYou points, orCapital One Miles. You can transfer all of these currencies to travel partners and redeem them for things like flights. (Note that, while Capital One calls its rewards currency ""miles,"" they aren't miles with a given airline program.) Find out more about what your credit card rewards are worth by reading Business Insider's guide towhat points and miles are worth in value. It won't be worth your while to use a cash-back credit card if you end up paying interest or late fees on what you owe. It's important to pay your balance in full each month, make those payments on time, and only spend what you can afford. Cash back cards vary greatly in their return rates: You can earn anywhere from 1% to 10% back depending on the purchase category, card, and issuer. Many cash-back cardsdon't charge annual fees, so you don't have to pay for the privilege of earning rewards. If you're new to rewards credit cards and aren't interested in earning travel points or miles, a cash back card is the best choice for you. With cash back cards, 1% back is always worth 1 cent, no matter what, and you can use your rewards to lower your monthly bill or transfer it to your checking account, among other options. The best cash-back credit card for you depends on your spending habits and whether you prefer a flat rate of cash back on all spending or earning bonus cash back on specific purchase categories and 1% on everything else. Flat-rate cash-back cards are best for those who don't want to keep track of multiple bonus categories and just want a simple earning structure. But if you really want to maximize your rewards earning, choosing a card that earns bonus cash back in categories where you spend a lot — like groceries, dining, or gas — can make a huge difference in your rate of return. To choose the best cash-back credit card for you, you'll want to consider a few things: Earning extra cash back for gas is pointless if you don't drive, while a credit card that earns bonus points on groceries isn't very useful if you don't cook. Consider how you intend to use your new card and compare the rate for those spending categories. Make sure you're clear on what you're earning. Is it statement credit? Cash? Points? If points, can they be combined with or transferred to other cards you have, or brands you like? An annual fee may make or break your choice. Are you willing to pay an annual fee — and more importantly, can you afford it comfortably, or will the cash back you'll earn in a year exceed the amount you pay? If this all sounds too complicated, you can't go wrong by using the Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card, which has no annual fee and a flat earning rate of 2% cash rewards on purchases. Cash back credit cards are often best used in combination with cards that earn points to create a complete credit card portfolio that takes advantage of multiple types of rewards. Pro tip:We don't mention a credit card's interest rate, because the APR only applies if you're carrying a balance on your credit card. We recommend applying for a cash back credit card intending to pay off the balance in full each month. For other categories of credit cards, like balance transfer cards, the APR might be a more important consideration. Cash-back credit cards have several pros and cons: Cash back credit cards earn the simplest form of rewards, where every point you earn is worth a fixed amount (usually 1 cent apiece). But thebest rewards credit cardscan offer much greater returns if you use your points for luxury travel experiences. It all comes down to whether you prefer the simplicity and flexibility of cash back instead of the higher potential (and increased complexity) of points and miles rewards. If you want to have the option of both types of rewards, consider pairing a card like the Chase Freedom Unlimited® with atravel rewards credit cardlike the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card. While the Chase Freedom Unlimited® earns cash back, transferring those rewards to the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card allows you to use your rewards for additional value throughChase Travel™ or viaChase Ultimate Rewards travel transfer partners. If you have a cash back credit card or are considering opening one, you'll want to make the most of it. Keep the following steps in mind to get the most value from your card: Credit card cash back or points aren't useful if you're carrying a balance and paying interest charges each month. To make the most of rewards, use your card responsibly: Spend only the money you have and pay your bill in full each month. Some cash-back cards offer elevated rewards rates on specific spending areas, like restaurants, gas stations, or supermarkets. Some of these cards even change those areas from quarter to quarter, meaning you'll want to stay on top of where your card earns the most and when. Expert tip:If you struggle to keep track of which cards earn how much, consider downloading acredit card rewards-tracking applike CardPointers to help you remember which card to use when checking out. If you use your cash-back card for every purchase, you don't need to be as diligent, but if you're using your card as one of many you'll want to be sure you know how to maximize rewards. It might be tempting to let your cash back pile up just to watch the total tick up, but it's more useful if you redeem it. You can generally apply the cash to your card balance or get it deposited in your checking account, and either one is a fine option. As mentioned above, in some cases, you can transfer cash back to a points-earning card on which your rewards are worth more. This strategy isn't required to make the most of your cash back card, but it can help take rewards to the next level. Chase cards are an example of this: If you hold a cash-back card like the Chase Freedom Flex®and a points-earning card like the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card, you can transfer rewards earned on the Freedom Flex to the Sapphire Preferred, and unlock more redemption options. Cash back credit cards can be slightly easier to get than premium rewards credit cards, which often require anexcellent credit scorefor approval. If you have a bad credit score, you may want to consider one of thebest starter credit cardsor one of thebest credit cards for bad credit, since some of the top options still earn rewards and allow you to upgrade to a better credit card after time and responsible use. Business Insider's financial experts evaluated dozens of cash-back credit cards and narrowed down our list by considering the following factors: See a full breakdown ofhow we rate credit cardsat Business Insider. A good best cash-back credit card should earn more than 1% per dollar spent on one or more categories. We recommend the Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card for flat-rate cash rewards, or the Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card if you spend a lot of money on restaurants, groceries, and entertainment. Yes, the Discover it Cash Back and the Chase Freedom Flex both earn 5% cash back on bonus categories that change every few months once activated up to a quarterly maximum, then 1%. Yes, 2% cash back or even 1.5% cash back can be well worth it if your card doesn't charge an annual fee, and you want to put all of your monthly expenses on a single card. The consistent returns and simplicity for your personal finances will help you come out ahead month after month. A cash back card can better than a travel or rewards card, depending on how you want to use your rewards. A cash-back credit card is ideal if you primarily want to put money back in your bank account rather than earn rewards you can redeem for travel — and many don't charge annual fees.

Rewards credit cards give you something back for every dollar you spend — whether that's points or miles for travel, or cash back that you can use to lower your monthly bill or to treat yourself to a splurge. To get the credit card you want, you'll need to have agood credit scoreat least, and ideally, an excellent credit score. You are most likely be approved for a credit card if your credit profile shows a lowcredit utilization ratio. If you currently carry a balance on an existing credit card, prioritizepaying off that debtas soon as possible before getting a new card to bring your credit score back up. Always pay off your balance in full, since any rewards you could earn will be wiped out by high interest rates from your existing card debt. Credit card rewards typically fall into a few categories. You can choose from flat-rate rewards, tiered bonus categories, cards that reward you for additional banking relationships, and rotating category cards. You can also choose between earning cash back or points and miles. In addition, many cards offer high welcome bonuses to new cardholders who meet a spending requirement in the first few months after opening a card. Some cards also include benefits like travel and purchase protection. The best way to optimize rewards card benefits is by making sure each dollar you spend earns at least 1.5 cents or more in value. You can do this by combining several credit cards in your wallet for different expenses — theAmerican Express® Gold Cardfor groceries and restaurants, for example, plus theChase Sapphire Preferred® Cardfor flights and hotels. Wondering what your rewards can buy? Some cards offer as many as 14 points per dollar on certain categories, but the points multiplier is only half of the equation. You also need to know how much each point is worth. Check out Business Insider's guide towhat points and miles are worthto understand how many cents you'll get in value with different loyalty currencies. These valuations are based on all the different ways you can use a given type of points or miles, from redeeming them as statement credits to transferring them to a travel partner to book a flight. The best rewards credit card for you should offer benefits you can use that are worth the annual fee (if there is one).

Best Travel Credit Cards,"There's an ideal travel credit card for every type of traveler, whether you're just dipping your toe into the world of travel rewards or have flown around the world on points. Business Insider evaluated dozens of travel rewards credit cards from national credit card issuers to identify the best options for new applicants, considering factors such as the welcome bonus, ongoing rewards, perks, and annual fees. We picked the best travel rewards credit cards by weighing the value of each card's range of benefits against its annual fee to decide if The Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card is our top-choice travel credit card for most people because it strikes the perfect balance between strong benefits and a moderate annual cost. Even infrequent travelers can easily justify the $95 annual fee with an annual statement credit of up to $50 off eligible hotel bookings through theChase Travel℠ Portal, and a 10% point bonus each year on your card renewal anniversary. The Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card earns 5 points on travel purchased through Chase Travel℠, 3 points on dining, select streaming services and online groceries, 2 points on all other travel purchases, and 1 point on all other purchases. While these earning rates are generous, the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card shines most with top-notch travel insurance benefits on par with premium travel rewards cards with far higher annual fees. When you pay for travel expenses with this card and meet certain requirements, you can request reimbursement for unexpected expenses that may arise when your flight is delayed or if your baggage is delayed or lost. You'll also enjoy primary rental car insurance coverage, so you won't have to file claims through your personal car insurance plan or pay for coverage from the rental car company. What we love:High welcome bonus offer, bonus points on travel, dining, and online grocery purchases, redeem points for 1.25 cents apiece for travel or through Chase for 25% value bonus What we don't love:Doesn't offer upscale travel perks such as airport lounge access and a statement credit for Global Entry Earn 5 points on travel purchased through Chase Travel℠. Earn 3 points on dining, select streaming services and online groceries. Earn 2 points on all other travel purchases. Earn 1 points on all other purchases. If you're new to travel rewards credit cards or just don't want to pay hundreds in annual fees, the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card is a smart choice. It earns bonus points on a wide variety of travel and dining purchases and offers strong travel and purchase coverage, including primary car rental insurance. The Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card is a great ""set it and forget it"" card for people who value simplicity when earning and redeeming travel rewards. Cardholders earn 5 miles per dollar on hotels, vacation rentals and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel and unlimited 2 miles per dollar on every other purchase. Capital One cardholders can use their miles to pay off eligible travel purchases on their recent card statements at a rate of 1 cent per mile. Capital One is the only credit card issuer that makes redeeming all travel purchases this easy — simply buy the flight or book the hotel you want, then use your rewards to ""erase"" the transaction from your outstanding balance. Alternatively, you cantransfer Capital Onerewards to more than a dozen frequent flyer and hotel loyalty programs. Finally, you can also book flights, hotels, and other reservations directly through theCapital One travel portaland use miles to pay at checkout.

Get $250 to use on Capital One Travel in your first cardholder year and earn 75,000 bonus miles If you want an easy, no-fuss travel rewards credit card, the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card is a great fit. For a moderate annual fee, it offers plenty of value, useful benefits, and a substantial welcome bonus. The Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card is our favorite travel credit card without an annual fee, and it offers many of the same perks as the Venture Rewards Card we just reviewed. The VentureOne Rewards Card only earns 1.25 miles per dollar on most purchases, compared to the 2 miles per dollar its bigger ""sibling"" earns. But the trade-off is that you don't have to pay an annual fee. You can also earn the same 5 points per dollar on hotels and car rentals booked through Capital One Travel. Cardholders can also transfer rewards to Capital One's airline and hotel partners — a rare benefit for a credit card with no annual fee. You'll also enjoy a handful of benefits including car rental insurance, travel accident insurance, and purchase assurance, making this card a permanent star in our guide to thebest Capital One credit cards. The VentureOne Rewards Card is also a solid pick if you want azero-interest credit card:New cardholders get a 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for 15 months (intro fee of 3% for the first 15 months, then 4% of the amount of each balance transfer at a promotional APR that Capital One may offer you at any other time), then a 19.24% - 29.24% Variable APR.

It's one of the few no-annual-fee cards on the market that gives you the option to redeem miles for cash back or transfer them to travel partners. Our third Capital One recommendation in a row is the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card, which is best for families because it comes with premium travel perks for the whole household. This sleek metal credit card is loaded with premium benefits includingairport lounge accessand an annual travel credit of up to $300, which more than offsets its $395 annual fee. Cardholders also get a 10,000-mile bonus on each account anniversary worth $100 toward travel. Families who frequently rent cars for travel can come out way ahead with this card, which earns 10 miles on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel, 5 miles per dollar on flights and vacation rentals booked through Capital One Travel, and 2 miles on all other purchases. As with other cards that earn Capital One miles, cardholders can transfer rewards to over a dozen airline and hotel partners to book award travel, use miles to book through the Capital One Travel Portal, or pay directly for travel and ""erase"" the transactions from their card statements. What we love:Airport lounge access at an affordable price, up to $300 annual travel credit What we don't love:The $300 credit is relatively restrictive and only applies to travel booked through Capital One Earn unlimited 10 miles on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.

The Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is one of the best credit cards for frequent travelers, with top-notch benefits and a wide range of built-in protections. It comes with a generous welcome bonus and credits that can help offset the annual fee — which is much lower than similar premium cards. The Chase Sapphire Reserve® is one of the best credit cards for people who buy travel insurance or enjoy adventure trips. This card comes with complimentary benefits for emergency evacuation and medical care, with sky-high coverage limit surpassing most standard policies you can buy. In addition to providing thebest credit card travel insurancefor worst-case scenarios, the Chase Sapphire Reserve® also protects you financially after mid-sized mishaps such as delayed or lost baggage and canceled or disrupted travel. Simply file a claim and submit all relevant information about the issue, and you'll be reimbursed for eligible incidents. This card has a $550 annual fee, which is why we no longer recommend this card for everyone. But if you travel often or aggressively enough to consider buying an annualtravel insurancepolicy, this card can be worth its annual fee many times over. Cardholders also get complimentary airport lounge access to Chase Sapphire Lounges and thePriority Pass™network of over 1,500 airport lounges worldwide (membership requires enrollment to activate). You'll also get a generous annual credit of up to $300 toward a broad range of travel expenses, from airfare to highway tolls. Cardholders earn 5 points per dollar on air travel purchased through Chase Travel℠, 10 points on hotels and car rentals purchased throughChase Ultimate Rewards(except on purchases that trigger the $300 travel credit), and 3 points per dollar on other travel and dining.

Earn 3 points on other travel and dining & 1 point per $1 spent on all other purchases. If you're new to rewards credit cards you may want to start elsewhere, but if you know you want to earn Chase points and you spend a lot on travel and dining, the Sapphire Reserve is one of the most rewarding options. The Citi Strata Premier℠ Card isn't as flashy or well-known as some other travel cards, but it's perfect for people who want a single credit card for earning bonus rewards from common household expenses. Cardholders earn a whopping 10Citi ThankYou pointsper dollar on hotels, rental cars, and attractions booked throughCiti Travel.

Cardholders also earn 4 points per dollar on flights and 3 points per dollar on restaurants and other travel purchases. This card has a $95 annual fee, inviting direct comparisons to two other cards on this list: the Sapphire Preferred Card and the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card. Unfortunately, the Wells Fargo Autograph Journey℠ Card isn't as strong as either competitor — yet — when it comes toWells Fargo Autograph transfer partners. But Wells Fargo'stransferrable credit card rewards programis relatively new, and may add new airline and hotel partners with time.

This card has a low annual fee on par with that of popular competing credit cards and Wells Fargo's also has a Points Transfer program that allows cardholders to juice maximum value from every point they earn. The Platinum Card® from American Express is arguably the most prestigious card available to most people without a personalized invitation. This swanky status symbol has a distinctive look and feel, with one of the highest annual fees of any travel card (rates and fees). But it offers far more than appearances, and can be well worth the cost if you can utilize most or all of the card's statement credits each year. Cardholders earn 5 points per dollar on flights when you book directly through the airline or throughAmerican Express Travel(on up to $500,000 per calendar year), which makes the card a great choice for purchasing airfare.

The One Key™ Card is ideal for people who frequently book short-term vacation home rentals through Vrbo. It's also great for travelers who use Hotels.com and Expedia, since it earns 3% in OneKeyCash™ on Expedia, Hotels.com, and Vrbo purchases and at gas stations, grocery stores, and on dining, and 1.5% on all other purchases. This card actually comes in two versions: the no-annual fee One Key™ Card, or the $99 One Key+™ Card. You can't go wrong with either card, so you should make your decision based on auxiliary perks. Both cards earn 3% back in OneKeyCash per dollar spent on bookings at Vrbo, Hotels.com, and Expedia, as well as on purchases at gas stations, restaurants, groceries, and food delivery services. But the One Key™ Card earns just 1.5% back on all other purchases, while the One Key+™ Card earns 2% back on all other purchases. You can offset the $99 annual fee on the One Key+™ Card with a $100 anniversary credit in OneKeyCash, as well as a statement credit of up to $120 toward Global Entry or TSA PreCheck® enrollment fees once every four years.

There's a card designed for people seeking free flights, hoping for free hotel stays, or just doing whatever it takes to realize their dreams of relaxing in an overwater bungalow. There are even no-annual-fee travel credit cards that won't cost you anything to maintain. Redeeming points or miles requires more effort than using simple cash back. But the upside is that you can get much more value for your points compared to simply cashing in your rewards for a statement credit or check at a rate of 1 cent per point. In fact, it's possible to receive double, triple, or even more than that amount when you're strategic about how you redeem your rewards, particularly if you book expensive luxury hotels or first-class flights. The right travel credit card can help you unlock incredible flights and hotel stays worth thousands of dollars apiece. In this guide, we've focused mostly on the best travel credit cards that earn transferable points. Transferable points include popular currencies such as: You can transfer these points to both airline and hotel partner loyalty programs. You can even redeem your points to offset the cash price of your travel at a flat rate. Business Insider's guide topoints and miles valuationscan help you determine what your airline miles, hotel points, and credit card rewards are worth. Here's ourmethodology for assigning valuations to your points and miles. Credit card rewards can be exhilarating to earn and redeem, but they're never worth incurring debt.

Best 0% APR Credit Cards,"A credit card with an initial period of 0% APR on purchases can help you save money when you need to carry a balance. 0% intro APR credit cards generally offer a period of 12 to 18 months where you can carry a balance interest-free; however, if you maintain a balance after the intro period, you will be charged the card's standard interest rate. These charges can add up quickly, and we recommend only making purchases that you know you can pay in full before your introductory period ends. Business Insider selected the best 0% introductory APR credit cards by analyzing nationally available credit cards, prioritizing those with the longest zero-interest periods on new purchases. We also evaluated rewards programs, including cash back and rewards points, card benefits, annual fees, and foreign transaction fees, to ensure the best overall value. 0% APR offer:0% intro APR for 21 months from account opening on purchases and qualifying balance transfers made within 120 days, followed by a 17.24%, 23.74%, or 28.99% Variable APR If you're looking for an ultra-long 0% APR, the no-annual-fee Wells Fargo Reflect® Card fits the bill.

With so many cards to choose from, your options may seem overwhelming. Here are some features to consider when evaluating no-interest credit cards to ensure you maximize your 0% intro APR benefits. The goal of a 0% intro APR credit card is to help you pay down a balance without incurring interest. If you use the card to buy something expensive, you'll want one that offers zero interest on new purchases. If you already have outstanding debt, you want a credit card that offers zero interest on balance transfers. If you plan to incur a mix of both types of debt, focus on cards that don't charge interest on both purchases and balance transfers. Your period of no interest won't last forever, and fees can quickly skyrocket if you miscalculate or misunderstand when your grace period ends. A best practice for avoiding unnecessary fees is to note your 0% intro APR expiration date on your calendar when you first receive the card, and set periodic reminders to check your outstanding balance and expiration date.You can always find your 0% APR rate and expiration date on your monthly statements, or call your credit card issuer for more details. Plenty of the best zero-interest credit cards don't charge annual fees, so there's no need to choose a 0% intro APR card with an annual fee unless the card offers additional benefits that make the cost worthwhile. A good 0% intro APR credit card should come with additional benefits and rewards in addition to the zero-interest period. Common perks include entertainment discounts and early access, travel advantages and protection, and credit score monitoring. Many credit cards offer the ability to check your FICO credit score for free. Issuers that offer this feature often provide monthly updates, and you can check your scores online or via your credit card app. Many issuers offer text and email alerts if they detect suspicious activity. In addition to preventing unauthorized transactions where possible, your credit card issuer may also offer a liability guarantee for fraudulent charges. Many credit cards now integrate with mobile payment systems like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay, making it easy to pay for your purchases using your smartphone or other devices. You may even be able to use your card immediately after approval if the issuer offers instant virtual credit card numbers. This is especially valuable if you apply for your zero-interest credit card right before you make a large purchase. Business Insider chose the best credit cards with 0% introductory APR offers by comparing all the available credit cards with zero-interest periods. We then evaluated the terms and length of each introductory offer, with cards that offer longer intro periods ranking more highly than others. We also considered rewards, like cash back or travel points, card benefits, and factors like annual fees and foreign transaction fees. Here's Business Insider's methodology forhow we rate credit cards. A 0% APR credit card offers an introductory period during which no interest is charged on purchases. This period typically ranges from 12 to 18 months, providing an opportunity for interest-free financing. Yes, you need to pay off your 0% interest credit card eventually because the intro APR offer won't last forever. During the introductory period, you typically need to make the minimum payment on the card (if not more) to avoid losing your intro 0% APR. You should make a plan to pay off your entire balance before the intro period ends to avoid paying interest on your remaining balance. You can get a 0% interest credit card by applying online. You can also check with your bank in person to see if it offers any 0% intro APR cards that appeal to you. Keep in mind most cards with intro APR offers require you to have at least agood credit score, which means aFICO scoreof 670 or higher. You can save money with a 0% intro APR credit card by making large purchases and paying them off over time without incurring interest charges. Additionally, you can transfer existing high-interest debt to the 0% intro APR card to reduce interest payments and pay down debt faster.

Best Balance Transfer Credit Cards,"If you're carrying credit card debt, you can reduce high interest by transferring your outstanding balance to a credit card that offers a period of zero interest, or 0% intro APR on balance transfers, when you first open the account.

With the Chase Slate Edge℠, you'll get a great 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for 18 months from account opening (then a 20.49% - 29.24% Variable APR).

The last thing you want to do is find yourself in the quicksand of credit card interest. Before you decide to use a 0% intro APR credit card, be sure you have the means and a plan to pay off your balance in full before the introductory APR period ends. Otherwise, you'll have to pay interest on your remaining balance. If you don't think you'll be able to pay off your debt in full by the time the introductory APR offer expires, a balance transfer credit card may not be worth it. A balance transfer credit card allows people with existing debt to move their outstanding balance over from another card to avoid interest fees. You can avoid interest on a balance transfer card thanks to an intro 0% APR offer, which lasts anywhere from nine to 21 months. After this introductory period is over, your APR will reset to the standard variable rate, so you must pay off your credit card debt in full before the intro APR period ends to avoid paying hefty interest charges. What's the catch? One disadvantage is that balance transfer credit cards typically charge an upfront fee of 3% to 5% of your balance. If you don't need to transfer a balance but need to make a large purchase that requires time to pay off, see our list of thebest zero interest credit cards. Like most things in life, balance transfer credit cards have their pros and cons. Our credit card experts reviewed Reddit and other popular online forums to see what current cardholders had to say about balance transfer credit cards. Balance transfer fees typically vary between 3% to 5%, and different cards charge different fees. In some cases, you may even receive a lower transfer fee rate early on when you first open the card. Cardholders say that balance transfer fees are significantly more affordable than the high interest rate accrued from credit card debt, and well worth paying if you have the option of doing so. If you have a choice between several different credit cards, opt for the one with the lowest balance transfer fee to save yourself some money. Most balance transfer credit card applications require good to excellent credit for approval. If you have a lower credit score, you may need to focus on a card like the Chase Slate Edge℠ for the time being, and use it responsibly to boost your credit in order to qualify for better products in future. If you qualify forNavy Federal Credit Unionmembership, look at an NFCU credit card such as the Navy Federal Credit Union Platinum Credit Card or the Navy Federal Credit Union GO REWARDS® Credit Card, which offer 0% intro APR or 0.99% intro APR deals from time to time (then a 10.99% - 18.00% Variable APR and 14.24% - 18.00% Variable APR, respectively). While these cards typically offer shorter interest-free periods and less benefits than those featured in ourbest credit cardsguide, they do not charge balance transfer fees. If you are confident you can pay off your balance in a few months, transferring your debt to an NFCU card can save you some interest. Business Insider selected the best balance transfer cards by looking at all the credit cards with balance transfer offers that are currently available to new applicants. From there, we narrowed our list to balance transfer cards offering 0% introductory offers. We arrived at our final picks by evaluating the terms of each introductory APR offer and other card benefits. We prioritized cards that charge lower balance transfer fees as well as cards with the longest 0% intro APR periods on balance transfers. We also factored in other card benefits, such as cash back or travel rewards, annual fees, and waived late fees. Here's Business Insider's methodology onhow we rate credit cards. Balance transfer cards allow you to pay lower interest rates on existing credit card debt, which can save you a significant amount of money in a short amount of time. With a balance transfer credit card, you'll pay a 3% to 5% fee per transaction to transfer existing debt from an existing card. To complete a balance transfer, you'll first have to apply and get approved for a balance transfer credit card. Once you have a card with an introductory APR offer on balance transfers, you'll need to initiate the transfer through the bank that issues your new balance transfer credit card. You can usually complete this process online, or by calling the number on the back of your 0% intro APR credit card. A balance transfer generally takes five to seven days, but the actual time can vary by issuer. Your bank may ask you to allow up to 21 days for a balance transfer to go through, but the transfer should usually be completed sooner. Balance transfer credit cards usually require at least agood credit scoreto qualify. If you have bad credit — typically defined as aFICO scorebelow 670 — you probably won't be approved for a balance transfer card. A bank may be less inclined to approve you for a balance transfer card if your credit score and credit report indicate that you haven't consistently paid off past debts. Balance transfers can affect your credit both positively and negatively. Opening a balance transfer credit card can help your credit score by increasing your total available credit, which in turn improves your credit utilization rate. Paying down your debt will also benefit your credit score. However, opening a new credit card triggers a hard inquiry on your credit report, which can decrease your credit score in the short term. You'll also pay a 3% to 5% balance transfer fee, which adds to your existing debt.

Unlike unsecured credit cards that extend a line of credit without collateral, secured cards require a small cash deposit upfront in order to secure an equally small line of credit. The Discover it® Secured Credit Card is widely considered to be one of the best secured credit cards because, unlike other cards in this niche, it doesn't charge an annual fee or any hidden fees.

It's unique because it earns strong rewards when most other secured credit cards do not. Our team of experts scoured online forums such as Reddit, Facebook, and FlyerTalk to see what everyday cardholders are saying about their favorite first credit cards for newbies. One online commenter rightly said, ""The best first credit card is the one you can actually get."" Applying for a credit card and getting rejected won't hurt your finances, but it's easiest to focus on attainable products, then upgrade or add to your wallet as you build credit. Discover is well-known to be especially friendly to first-time credit card applicants, which is why we've included the Discover it® Student Chrome, Discover it® Student Cash Back, and the Discover it® Secured Credit Card in this guide. And if you get theChase Freedom Rise℠and open aChase bankaccount to build your relationship with this major issuer, it will be easier to get approval for popular cards such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve® down the road. Since theChase Freedom Rise℠automatically upgrades to the Chase Freedom Unlimited® after one year, you'll be able to transfer rewards you earned from your Rise/Unlimited card to the Sapphire card, then use those rewards toward a variety of travel opportunities at a fraction of the cash value.

Some recommend theBlue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express, which earns 6% back on groceries at U.S. supermarkets and streaming subscriptions as well as 3% back on gas and transit costs (1% on everything else). However, Amex cards can be harder to acquire for first-time applicants, since American Express often has stringent requirements for credit approval.Instead, beginners can consider the Capital One Savor Student Cash Rewards Credit Card, which earns 3% back on restaurants, groceries, streaming services, and entertainment purchases (1% on everything else). Most students, young adults, and individuals new to credit can easily maximize these spending categories, and responsible usage on this card will build good credit over time that will help toward qualifying for premium cards from Amex. When choosing a first credit card, it's important to consider features such as low or 0% intro APR, low or no annual fees, rewards programs, and credit-building tools. These features can help you effectively manage your credit effectively and take advantage of benefits such as purchase protection, travel insurance, and extended warranty. All of the cards we've reviewed here offer perks that enhance your financial security and protect your investments. Students, young adults, and beginners who are un- or underemployed face unique challenges when applying for credit cards because they have less income than many issuers want to see when offering credit.

Read ourChase Ink Business Preferred card reviewto learn more about this card. The Business Platinum Card® from American Express is the business version of the famousAmex Platinum Card,and was Business Insider's former top-choice business card. However, this card's annual fee has increased to $695 since then, and it's become a bit more of a niche product. The Business Platinum Card® from American Express is potentially useful for midsize businesses that spend a lot on flights and travel, but less valuable for sole proprietors and smaller companies.

With this card, you earn 2% cash back on all eligible purchases, on the first $50,000 spent per calendar year, then 1% back (cash back is received in the form of Reward Dollars that can be redeemed as a statement credit).

The Ink Business Unlimited® Credit Card is a simple one at first glance, earning unlimited 1.5% cash back. However, just like the consumerChase Freedom Flex®and Chase Freedom Unlimited® cards, the Ink Business Unlimited® Credit Card has a trick up its sleeve. Although the card is marketed as ""cash back,"" it earns Chase Ultimate Rewards points that you can redeem for cash (1 Chase point = 1 cent).

And once you understand earning and reward structures, you can also maximize your rewards across common spending categories such as shipping fees, office supplies, or travel. You can choose from several types of business credit cards:cash-back business credit cards,business credit cards for travel, premium cards with exclusive benefits such as airport lounge access, travel insurance, and more, andbusiness credit cards with no annual fee. You may also be able to take advantage of zero-interest intro APRs and interest-free periods. In addition to providing our expert take on the best cards available right now, our credit card experts also compiled customer experiences and reviews across forums such as Reddit and FlyerTalk to see what other business owners have to say. Many business owners like the flexibility of earning cash back because it's so versatile. Travel rewards are often worth more when compared to the cash value of business- and first-class flights and five-star hotel stays, but cash back is the easiest and most quantifiable way to calculate true value. Some Redditors appreciate payment flexibility features that are unique to small business credit cards. For example, The Plum Card® from American Expressoffers a 1.5% discount if you pay off what you owe before it's due. However, Business Insider's credit card experts don't recommendThe Plum Cardfor most business owners because it has a relatively high annual fee of $250 in exchange for minimal benefits beyond the early-pay discount. Many business credit cardholders mention the value of a credit card 0% intro APR, whether it's for purchases, balance transfers, or both. Zero-interest terms allow business owners to pay down large expenses, such as new equipment or commercial rent, over a longer period of time without incurring additional costs in the form of interest. Of course, after the initial period ends, you'll return to paying high rates of interest, so make sure you plan ahead to pay off the full amount you owe before your 0% APR term runs out. Many small business owners look for business credit cards that earn points or cash back within the same issuer ""ecosystems"" that they already use for personal credit cards. For example, many people who have one or more of thebest Chase cardsfor consumers gravitate toward thebest Chase business credit cardsbecauseearning and using Chase Ultimate Rewards pointsis easy between business and personal accounts. The best business credit cards often earn bonus rewards on specific purchases that pair well with benefits or bonus categories on personal cards.American Express credit cardswork well together, just like Chase cards do. For example, The Blue Business® Plus Credit Card from American Express pairs well with theAmerican Express® Gold CardandThe Platinum Card® from American Express, which are two of the most popular consumer credit cards offered through Amex. Business owners who bank with Bank of America have access to theBank of America Preferred Rewards loyalty program benefits, which earns additional cash back depending on how much money you deposit with Bank of America or Merrill. People who value cash back frequently tout the benefits of combining a cash-back credit card like the Bank of America® Business Advantage Unlimited Cash Rewards Mastercard® Credit Cardwith otherBank of Americabanking accounts. Business road warriors rave about travel-related benefits associated with certain business credit cards such as access to airport lounges, earning miles on travel purchases, and additional perks like priority boarding and free checked bags. We've highlighted the premium benefits of The Business Platinum Card® from American Express and the everyday rewards from The Blue Business® Plus Credit Card from American Express in this guide. But you may also want to consider other options if you frequently find yourself traveling for business. Many of the cards Redditors recommend are featured in our guide to thebest business credit cards for travel. Few people get excited about accounting tools and features, but they can be a lifesaver for managing and organizing business expenses. Redditors emphasized the importance of finding business credit cards that offer authorized user and employee credit cards, or integrate with Quickbooks and other common accounting software tools for accurate cash flow management and efficient financial tracking. Business credit cards also help users separate business expenses from personal finances, which is important for clean accounting and for establishing business credit. Many small business credit cards rely on consumer credit scores for approval, so business owners with low personal credit may find it hard to get approved for a business credit card. Secured business credit cards can be the solution here. The best options help businesses build credit history by reporting responsible use to business credit bureaus, and some offer the option to upgrade to an unsecured card for better credit with responsible use. Redditors who don't otherwise qualify for business credit cards recommend looking at several of the cards in our guide to thebest secured business credit cards. These cards require a cash security deposit, which usually equates to the credit limit you want to set on the credit card.

Joining FoundersCard doesn't come cheap, costing several hundred dollars each year depending on which membership tier you choose. But it can be worth many times its annual fee for the right demographic: people who frequently travel for business and pleasure, and value premium experiences and top-tier service while doing so. Our dedicated review delves deeper intowhat FoundersCard is and whether it's worththe investment. Some of the best credit cards for small businesses include the Ink Business Unlimited® Credit Card for earning 1.5% back on every dollar spent; The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card for earning 2% cash back (on up to $50,000 per year in purchases, then 1%); the U.S. Bank Triple Cash Rewards Visa® Business Card for a long intro APR period and generous rewards rate; and The Business Platinum Card® from American Express for premium travel perks including access to the Amex Centurion Lounges in airports worldwide (terms apply).

Discover it Cash Back Credit Card,"I've been hearing about the Discover it Cash Back for years, and finally applied for one this summer. This card is one of Business Insider's picks for ourbest credit cardsguide because it earns 5% cash back on different purchases that change every three months (from January 1 to March 31, 2025, earn 5% cash back at restaurants, home improvement stores, and select streaming services on up to $1,500 in purchases after enrollment, then 1%). I chose thisno-annual-fee credit cardfor two specific reasons: New cardholders get 0% intro APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers (then 18.24% - 27.24% Variable APR), and double their cash-back at the end of their first year. Earn 5% cash back on everyday purchases at different places you shop each quarter like grocery stores, restaurants, gas stations, and more, up to the quarterly maximum when you activate. Earn unlimited 1% cash back on all other purchases automatically. 0% intro APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers The Discover it® Cash Back is one of the best credit cards that offers 5% back on popular rotating categories up to a spending limit. Your rewards are matched by Discover after the first 12 months, and the card has no annual fee. I got this credit card because I wanted cash back and 0% intro APR. But my favorite aspects of the Discover it Cash Back have been a pleasant surprise for me. Discover instantly approved me for the Discover it Cash Back, and immediately offered me access to my new credit card number while I waited for the physical product to appear in the mail. This perk is a ""nice to have"" in most cases, but can be a ""need to have"" if you need to make a large or unexpected transaction on short notice. I didn'tneed-need it this time, but did use my new card to pay for dinner via Apple Wallet mere minutes after I was approved. I have dozens of credit cards and bank accounts, so I've become something of a financial website and app connoisseur. The Discover website and consumer app are pleasantly intuitive and user-friendly, a feature I deeply appreciate from my credit card issuers. Both portals are sleek and contemporary, a feature my fellow Millennial or Gen Z consumers will appreciate. In fact, Discover's layout might be my new favorite amongst bank apps. I've become a big fan of Face ID for phone log-ins, and I was able to quickly set up and use this feature on the Discover app. I also like the single-page overview format, which allows me to scroll for the information I want instead of blindly clicking through multiple tabs. The landing page shows me at a glance how much of a balance I'm carrying, and how much of my credit limit is still available for use. I can also see how much cash back I've already earned — a feature that's much less prominent from Chase or Amex. For more granular detail, the payments, rewards, and services tab quickly show me most of the other information I need including contact information for Discover customer support. I like getting a good deal when I shop, and I don't mind expending a little extra brainpower at checkout. I wanted to get the Discover it Cash Back because it earn 5% back on bonus categories that change every few months (from January 1 to March 31, 2025, earn 5% cash back at restaurants, home improvement stores, and select streaming services on up to $1,500 in purchases after enrollment, then 1%). I track these rotations using theDiscover cash back calendar, which announces new promotion categories a few weeks before the next quarter begins. I don't earn 5x until I enroll in the promotion, so I make sure to register my card at the beginning of each quarter so the benefit is active on my account. I can earn 5% on the first $1,500 I spend across all bonus categories that quarter — a potential reward of $75 if I max out the full amount. I also have aChase Freedom Flex®in my wallet that also earns 5% cash back onquarterly bonus categories. Doubling up on both no-annual-fee credit cards allows me to save a lot of money on common expenses such as gas, groceries, Amazon, or Paypal transactions. The Chase Freedom Flex also caps rewards at $1,500 per quarter — another $75 potential cash back. Most credit cards offer a welcome bonus when you first apply. These offers typically give new cardholders a certain amount of money or points after they spend a designated sum of cash on the card within a specific number of days. For example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card offers newcomers the chance to earn 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening. In contrast, the Discover it Cash Back doesn't offer a traditional welcome bonus that follows this format. Instead, Discover'sCashback Match®program matches all of the cash back I've earned at the end of my first year, whether I earn it from 5% cash-back categories or from 1% cash back on all other purchases. Since I primarily plan to use my Discover it Cash Back on bonus-category purchases each quarter, I could theoretically earn a grand total of $600 during my first year — a generous return from ano-annual-fee credit card. 5% on up to $1,500 per quarter = $75 Pro Tip:The Discover it Cash Back doesn't charge foreign transaction fees — and neither do any other Discover cards. I have plenty of Visa and Amex credit cards, and I've even added a couple of Mastercards in the last year or two. But until I got my own Discover it Cash Back this summer, I hadn't had — or even seen — a Discover card since the early 1990s when I used to poke through my mother's wallet. For many years, I assumed this was because Discover cards aren't as widely accepted as Visa, Amex, or Mastercards. While they are still less popular in many international countries, I discovered you can now use Discover cards in most places throughout the U.S. that accept credit cards. They're also accepted in Canada, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and China. I probably won't take this card overseas with me because of those geographical limitations. But it's nice to know that I won't pay foreign transaction fees if I do need to use it in a pinch. Most credit cards have a standard design, while some statement products like the American Express® Gold Card or the The Platinum Card® from American Express offer a couple of different looks. In contrast, the Discover it Cash Back offers more than two dozen designs for cardholders to choose from — a fun surprise for me to discover during the card application process. I'd never choose a credit card based on aesthetics alone, but I'll take a rainbow card any time I'm given the option. Personal finance experts stress the importance of paying off credit card balances in full each month, with one exception: If you have access to a 0% interest period on your credit card, it may make sense to charge a large transaction to that card and pay off what you owe over the 0% APR period. This is one of my favorite ways to make big expenses a little more palatable. Property taxes run high where I live: I pay 2.2% of my appraised home value yearly. To soften the blow, I occasionally charge the full transaction to a zero-interest credit card, then pay off what I owe over the duration of my 0% APR period. This allows me to invest my money in ahigh-yield savings accountfor a few months. Paying my taxes on a new credit card also helps me hit the spending requirement necessary for a welcome bonus. The Discover it Cash Back comes with a generous 0% intro APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers (then 18.24% - 27.24% Variable APR). This is one of the longest zero-interest periods offered on a credit card with above-average rewards, especially without an annual fee. I plan to redeem my Discover it Cash Back rewards as a statement credit each month to lower my outstanding balance. I have plenty oftravel rewards credit cardsthat earntransferrable credit card rewards, so a refreshing change to use my Discover rewards purely for cash back. While I don't plan to do so, you can also deposit the cash directly into your bank account or redeem your rewards whenchecking out at Amazon. In any of these cases, the minimum redemption amount is 1 cent. Another option is to donate your rewards to select charities at a minimum of 1 cent, including the American Cancer Society, the ASPCA, the American Red Cross, Carbonfund.org, Children's Miracle Network, Junior Achievement, Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, Make-A-Wish, Operation Homefront, and World Wildlife Fund. The Discover it Cash Back also has some useful protection features I haven't needed to use yet: If I misplace my card, I can quickly freeze my card with a single tap on the main Activity page within my Discover app. Discover can also search the web for security breaches involving my Social Security number via the free Discover Identity Alerts tool, and remove my info from information-collecting websites through the Discover Online Privacy Protection program. I have free access to myFICO credit scoreat any time within the Discover app activity page by scrolling down to the Card Benefits section and clicking on my ""FICO Credit Scorecard"". Discover typically offers low fees on credit card andbankingproducts, and there's no exception here. The Discover it Cash Back doesn't have an annual fee orforeign transaction fees, and most other charges are easy to avoid. As with all credit cards, I won't owe any interest if I pay off my statement balance in full by the due date each month. As with most credit cards, the Discover it Cash Back does charge fees for the following activities: The Discover it Cash Back doesn't list any major purchase protections or travel insurance benefits, so I only plan to use this card for groceries, dining, or other bonus-category transactions that don't require a robust return policy. I'll probably stick with one of myChase credit cards with purchase protectionif I need to purchase expensive electronics such as a laptop or a TV, where I might want to take advantage of extended warranty benefits. And if I decide to buy a flight or other travel, I'll stick with one of mybest credit cards with travel insurancesuch as theCapital One Venture X Rewards Credit Cardor theChase Sapphire Reserve®. The Discover it® Cash Back card is a good choice for those with credit scores in the good to excellent range — a FICO score of at least 670, or aVantageScoreof at least 700.If you're not quite there yet, there are other Discover cards you may qualify for. TheDiscover it® Secured Credit Cardis designed for people who are arenew to creditor rebuilding credit. And theDiscover it® Student Cash Backis anexcellent option for college studentswho don't have a long credit history. When you open an eligible new Discover card, theDiscover Cashback Match®program will match all the rewards you earned after the first 12 months with no caps, including your bonus category rewards. For instance, if I earn $400 in rewards within my first year of having the Discover it® Cash Back, Discover will match that for a total of $800 back after my first 12 months. The Discover it® Cash Back caps 5% bonuses at a maximum of $1,500 spent across all bonus categories each quarter (or $75 cash back total). All other transactions earn unlimited 1% cash back per dollar spent, including on bonus categories after the $1,500 threshold has been met. The Discover it® Cash Back is a great card if you prefer earning cash back instead of travel points and don't want to pay an annual fee. It can also be a good pick if the quarterly bonus categories match up with your spending. People who want extra benefits such as annual travel credits should consider other credit cards with better rewards. Every quarter, the Discover it® Cash Back offers new bonus categories that earn 5% cash back per dollar spent. These categories typically cover common expenses such as gas, groceries, Amazon, Paypal, or Target purchases. You must activate the promotion via your online account dashboard or the Discover app before you qualify for the 5x bonus. Rewards are capped at 5% of $1,500 spent across all bonus categories each quarter. After that, your earning rate drops back down to 1% per dollar spent. You'll typically earn cash back within days of the transaction posting to your credit card statement, although Discover says rewards can take up to two billing cycles to appear on your account. When evaluating the Discover it® Cash Back, I considered the card's annual fee, welcome bonus, rewards, benefits, and how well it stacks up to similar credit cards like theChase Freedom Flex®.

Chase Sapphire Preferred Credit Card,"Earn 5 points on travel purchased through Chase Travel℠. Earn 3 points on dining, select streaming services and online groceries. Earn 2 points on all other travel purchases. Earn 1 points on all other purchases. If you're new to travel rewards credit cards or just don't want to pay hundreds in annual fees, the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card is a smart choice. It earns bonus points on a wide variety of travel and dining purchases and offers strong travel and purchase coverage, including primary car rental insurance. As Business Insider's correspondent covering all things credit cards, I'm often a resource for friends and family members looking to get a new card. Many people focus on credit card rewards above all else, but I primarily recommend the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card for its fantastic benefits, including travel reimbursements for flight cancellations and lost bags, primary rental car insurance coverage, a $50 annual hotel credit, and bonus points on dining and travel. Business Insider's personal finance experts agree: The Sapphire Preferred Card is an industry leader across several of our credit card guides, topping our best credit card lists for rewards and travel. The Sapphire Preferred Card earns bonus points on various travel and dining purchases. But this card's travel insurance protections are its most valuable benefit. These protections include primary car rental coverage, as well as trip cancellation and interruption insurance. If that sounds like a bunch of gibberish, here's what that really means: If someone dents my rental car while it's in my possession, I can file a claim through Chase instead of my personal car insurance company. If my bags are lost or delayed by an airline, I can buy basic necessities like toothpaste or extra socks and get reimbursed for the money I spend. And if my flight is canceled or delayed overnight or for more than 12 hours, these benefits will cover up to $500 per ticket in unexpected expenses, such as meals and a hotel room, for myself and any travel companions whose tickets were purchased on my credit card. This card also comes with a generous welcome bonus for new cardholders that offsets a reasonable $95 annual fee, making it affordable for most peopl who travel at least once a year. The Sapphire Preferred Card also includes a $50 annual credit for hotels booked through theChase Travel℠ Portal, a 10% anniversary points bonus, and up to 5 points per dollar in popular spending categories. The current Sapphire Preferred Card intro bonus goes a long way: 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening. This welcome offer is worth $1,080 in travel, based on Business Insider'spoints and miles valuations. That's enough for a vacation to Hawaii during shoulder season if I'm savvy with my spending. Sapphire Preferred Cardholders earn points at the following rates per dollar spent: If you close your credit card, you'll lose all the points in your account. So, if you cancel this credit card, be sure to redeem your rewards, combine them with rewards on another partner credit card in the Chase family, or transfer them to aChase Ultimate Rewards points partner. I like pairing the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card with a cash-back card from Chase like the Chase Freedom Flex®. Both cards earn Ultimate Rewards, but they have different bonus categories. I can transfer the points from my Chase Freedom Flex to my Sapphire Preferred Card for additional value, essentially doubling my stash of rewards. Chase Ultimate Rewards® points are worth 1 cent apiece when redeemed through Chase Travel℠. But Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card holders get a 25% redemption value bonus, so my rewards are worth 1.25 cents apiece when if I combine my stash before booking travel through Chase. Sapphire Preferred Cardholders can redeem Ultimate Rewards points for flights, hotels, rental cars, and more through the Chase Travel℠ portal at the 1.25-cent rate with no limits or blackout dates. The redemption system searches many airline and hotel brands, with a similar feel and layout to major discount travel websites. Booking Directly vs. Using A Third-Party Online Travel Agency (OTA) You'll often find cheaper rates from the hotel or airline, and changes or cancellations are trickier if you don't book direct. Most hotel chains also won't let you earn credit toward elite status if you book through a third-party company like Expedia, Travelocity — or Chase Travel℠. That being said, there's always a time and place to use the Chase Travel℠ portal. I typically recommend using the portal to use up travel credit, such as the $50 annual hotel credit for stays booked through Chase. Transferring Ultimate Rewards to Chase partners usually helps you get the most value out of your points.  Chase has 14 different airline and hotel partners, and points transfer at a 1:1 ratio, meaning 1 Chase point equals 1 point or mile in the following programs: There are plenty of non-travel options for redeeming your Chase points. I never recommend doing so because these redemptions are worth far less per point. Paypal and Amazon redemptions are a terrible idea, since you lose 20% of the minimum point value when you use your rewards here. If you want to use your rewards for these merchants, I recommend paying for your purchase with the Sapphire Preferred Card, then redeeming your points toward a statement credit at 1 cent apiece. The Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card's benefits come in handy when traveling and shopping at home, online, or anywhere your travels take you. The Sapphire Preferred Card comes with up to $50 in annual statement credits toward hotel stays booked through Chase Travel℠. You can use this credit immediately if you're a new cardholder, and the credit renews each year after your card renewal anniversary. Even if you hate the idea of paying a credit card annual fee, hear me out: Taking advantage of this $50 annual credit drops the net cost of your $95 annual fee to just $45 every year. Each year on your account anniversary, you'll receive a points bonus equal to 10% of all purchases made in the previous year. For example, if I spend $25,000 on the card in a 12-month period, I'll get a bonus of 2,500 points — enough to get me to New Orleans and back on Southwest during low season. The next few benefits are some of the best perks of the Sapphire Preferred Card. The Sapphire Preferred Card includes primary car rental insurance for damage due to theft or collision. Primary coverage means your credit card benefits kick in before your personal auto insurance policy. You don't need to file a claim with your own insurer, which can cost you a lot more in premiums down the road. I've never needed to file a rental car claim using this perk — knock on wood — but plenty of travelers have shared success stories on online forums such as Reddit and FlyerTalk. (Of course, there are plenty of exceptions or misunderstandings as well, so make sure you carefully read your benefit terms and conditions before renting your vehicle as well as if you encounter any issues during the rental period.) This rental car protection benefit also means you can skip purchasing insurance through the car rental agency in most countries when you rent a vehicle and pay with the Sapphire Preferred Card. Most cars and countries are included, but some countries and some car models are excluded from this benefit. So make sure you read the fine print before you waive insurance coverage from the rental car company. For instance, I had to purchase local insurance when I rented a car in Ireland. (I was grateful for the protection while I drove on the left side of those narrow roads!) Note:Your credit card rental car coverage doesn't include liability insurance, which covers claims that result from injuries and damage you or your vehicle may cause to other people or property. If a trip you booked using this card is cut short or canceled for an eligible reason such as illness or severe weather, the travel insurance benefit on this card will reimburse up to $10,000 per person and $20,000 per trip for pre-paid, non-refundable travel expenses. This protection can be especially valuable for pricy or time-specific adventures, which often cannot be rescheduled to a later date. For example, I got really lucky with great weather when I went to Antarctica, but the group of travelers behind me didn't even get to set sail for the continent due to inclement conditions. If one of those travelers had had this credit card, they could have filed a claim for reimbursement if they weren't able to sail on the next cruise offered to them. When you use your Sapphire Preferred Card to pay for airfare, the trip delay insurance benefit can reimburse you for up to $500 per ticket for hotel rooms, food, toiletries, clothes, or other reasonable expenses when your flight is delayed overnight, or by 12 hours or more. If you've paid for your travel with the Sapphire Preferred Card and your bags are delayed for six hours or more, you could be reimbursed for essential purchases such as clothing and toiletries, up to $100 per day for up to five days. I have personally used this Chase protection benefit (on another card) to cover nearly one week's worth of unexpected expenses. I've also helped friends file claims for trip delay expenses during the recent CrowdStrike travel fiasco, helping them reclaim hundreds of dollars' worth of last-minute charges when their airline left them high and dry. If the carrier damages or loses your bags, you and your immediate family members could be covered for up to $3,000 per passenger as long as you've paid for your tickets with the Sapphire Preferred Card. When you purchase certain goods with the Sapphire Preferred Card, the card's warranty benefit extends a U.S. manufacturer's warranty by one additional year on warranties of three years or less. If an eligible item you've bought with the Sapphire Preferred Card is damaged or stolen within 120 days of purchase, you may be able to claim up to $500 in reimbursement per purchase, and up to $50,000 per credit card account. If you're traveling away from home and need help, cardholder emergency assistance can help you find medical and legal referrals. This service is free for Sapphire Preferred Card cardholders, but any third-party costs are your responsibility. When you pay for your air, bus, cruise, or train transportation with the Sapphire Preferred Card, you're eligible for accidental death or dismemberment coverage of up to $500,000. Sapphire Preferred Card cardholders can contact the roadside dispatch hotline for help with arranging services like towing and flat tire repair for a set fee. Sapphire Preferred Card get a complimentary DashPass membership (for waived delivery fees on qualifying orders) through December 31, 2027. You have to enroll through Chase to receive this perk. As of Summer 2024, cardholders also get a $10 monthly credit for a grocery, convenience, or retail order. Restaurants aren't included, and you'll often pay hefty service fees for delivery. But I like to maximize this benefit by searching for stores that offer a pick-up option to make the most of my $10 discount. In many cases, 7-Eleven may be the only store in your area that offers pick-up options, but you'd be surprised by how many goodies you can get there with a free $10. The Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card has a $95 annual fee. Many people preferno-annual-fee credit cards, but I find the peace of mind I get from trip cancellation insurance and primary rental car coverage is worth far more than $95 a year. The Sapphire Preferred Card has a 20.49% - 27.49% Variable APR. I always recommend paying off your full statement balance every month, and never charging more to your credit card than you can afford. The interest rate on this card is no exception: Your debt will add up very quickly if you carry a balance at this rate of interest. The Sapphire Preferred Card does not charge any foreign transaction fees when you shop outside the U.S. Foreign transaction fees typically cost an additional 3% to 5% on top of your purchase, and I've saved hundreds of dollars over the years by only using credit cards that don't charge these fees. As with most other credit cards, you'll have to pay fees for credit card balance transfers, cash advances, late payments, and returned payments. The Chase Sapphire Reserve, one of the best premium travel credit cards available, is the top-tier ""sibling"" of the Sapphire Preferred Card. The Chase Sapphire Reserve has a $550 annual fee compared to a $95 annual fee on the Sapphire Preferred Card. The Chase Sapphire Reserve comes with up to a $300 annual travel credit and access to more than 1,500 airport lounges through its complimentary Priority Pass™ membership. Cardholders can also redeem Ultimate Rewards through the Chase portal at a value of 1.5 cents apiece, compared to the 1.25 cents apiece for Sapphire Preferred Card. Chase Sapphire Reserve cardholders earn 10 points on Lyft rides through March 2025; 10 points on hotels and car rentals booked through Chase; 10 points on Chase Dining; 5 points on airfare through Chase Travel℠; 3 points on other dining and travel; and earn 1 point per dollar on all other purchases. If you want a mid-tier travel credit card that earns American Express Membership rewards, the Amex Gold Card is a good option for you to consider. Cardholders earn 4 Membership Rewards® points on purchases at restaurants worldwide (on up to $50,000 in purchases per calendar year, then 1 point), 4 points at US supermarkets (on up to $25,000 in purchases per calendar year, then 1 point), 3 points on flights booked directly with airlines or on AmexTravel.com, 2 points on prepaid hotels and other eligible purchases booked on AmexTravel.com, and 1 point on all other eligible purchases New Amex Gold cardholders can earn 60,000 Membership Rewards® Points after you spend $6,000 on eligible purchases on your new card in your first six months of card membership, and can benefit from extra perks at Amex Hotel Collection properties when booked through Amex; secondary car rental insurance; trip delay insurance; baggage insurance; extended warranty; purchase protection; and up to $120 in Uber Cash each year (up to $10 per month) after adding the card as a method of payment in your Uber account. Amex Gold Card cardholders who enroll in the benefit can can also get a $10 monthly dining credit at Grubhub, The Cheesecake Factory, Goldbelly, Wine.com, and Five Guys. This card has an annual fee of $325, which is significantly higher than that of the Sapphire Preferred Card. The Venture Rewards Card is nearly identical to the Sapphire Preferred Card, but for people who prefer Capital One as a credit card issuer. New cardholders can earn a welcome bonus of 75,000 miles once you spend $4,000 on purchases within the first three months of account opening, plus $250 to use on Capital One Travel in your first cardholder year. The card has an annual fee of $95, and earns a flat rate of 2 miles per dollar on most purchases. They will earn 5 miles per dollar on hotels, vacation rentals and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel. We compared the Sapphire Preferred Card to similar travel rewards credit cards and assessed the card on various factors, including: Read more abouthow we rate credit cards. To be eligible to apply for the Sapphire Preferred Card, you have a credit score in the good to excellent range. However, Chase only allows you to have one Sapphire card at a time, so if you already have the card (or its sibling, the Chase Sapphire Reserve), you won't be approved. For consumers who travel and dine out on occasion, the $95 is worth the annual fee. The annual fee might seem intimidating if you've only hadno-annual-fee cardsin the past, but the card pays for itself pretty quickly with a $50 annual credit for hotels booked through Chase and generous rewards on dining, online groceries, and travel purchases. The Sapphire Preferred Card earns Chase Ultimate Rewards points, which you can redeem for travel booked through Chase, statement credits, gift cards, and merchandise. The best way to use your rewards is usually by transferring them to Chase's airline and hotel partners, because you can often get outsized value from your points this way. Yes, Chase has more than a dozen airline and hoteltransfer partnersincluding Marriott, United, and Southwest. You're most likely to be approved for the Sapphire Preferred Card if you have a credit score ranging betweengoodtoexcellent(670 or higher). The Sapphire Preferred Card does not charge extra to add authorized users. Additional cardholders get their own card, but any points earned from their spending will belong to the primary cardholder. Keep in mind any transactions made by your authorized users are your responsibility, so only add folks you trust. The minimum credit limit for the Sapphire Preferred Card is usually $5,000 because it's a Visa Signature card. Many people get approved for credit limits that are higher than that. No, the Sapphire Preferred Card doesn't come with a TSA PreCheck® or Global Entry credit. However, its sibling, the Chase Sapphire Reserve, does offer this feature.

While this is a good option for anyone with credit scores in the lower 600s, those with better credit could find better rates elsewhere.

Upstart differentiates itself from other personal loan lenders with its underwriting process, which is how it decides who gets a loan and how much to charge in interest.

Look out for:Potentially high origination fees. Upstart's personal loans can have late fee of 5% or $15, whichever is greater. This can take a significant portion out of your overall loan proceeds.

We looked at loan providers that cater to a variety of credit scores and offer a range of loan term lengths. The best personal loans aren't necessarily from big-name banks; credit unions generally offer lower interest rates, and you can find strong options through online banks, too. A personal loan is aninstallment loan. That means you borrow money and pay it back with a set repayment schedule of monthly payments over a designated period of time. Most personal loans areunsecured, meaning they don't require you to put down collateral. Since the lender has no collateral to collect if you default on your loan, it can charge higher interest rates for you to borrow. With asecured loan, on the other hand, you'll put down collateral to ""secure"" the money you borrow. Mortgages are examples of secured loans since the house you're paying off can be repossessed if you fail to keep up with payments. Auto loans are also considered secured loans, as cars are tangible assets that the lender can repossess if you default on repayment. Since secured loans are backed by collateral, lenders generally charge less in interest fees. However, most personal loans fall under the unsecured category. That doesn't mean you can't score a low interest rate; if you have a high credit score, you're in a good position to secure the lowestpersonal loan interest rateseven with an unsecured loan. Personal loans also usually come with fixed interest rates. This means the amount of interest you'll pay will stay the same for the entire loan term. With variable-rate personal loans, on the other hand, the interest rate you pay may start out low, but it can change at any time based on market conditions. Many borrowers prefer fixed-rate loans because they offer predictability; your monthly payment won't change, for better or worse. Interest rates for unsecured personal loans are determined largely by your credit score. The higher your credit score, the better your chances of getting the lowest available personal loan interest rates. You can get a personal loan through three types of lenders: Online lenders can provide convenience and offer competitive rates. They typically offer a streamlined qualification and application process, allowing borrowers to apply and receive funds entirely online. Online lenders frequently cater to borrowers with a wide range of credit scores. Banks are the traditional sources of personal loans with established reputations and familiarity. You can visit a local branch to discuss loan options and receive personalized assistance. Some banks offer perks including discounts for existing customers. Credit unions are member-owned financial institutions. They often offer better rates and fees compared to banks, for members in good standing. Credit unions can also be more flexible in their lending criteria for borrowers with lower credit scores. Interest rates forcredit union personal loansare capped at 18% by the National Credit Union Administration. To pick the best lender for you, take stock of the factors that are most important to you. Many borrowers zero in on the lowest interest rate. But be sure to also look at any fees, the minimum credit score needed, and the accessibility of the lender's customer service before you apply for personal loans. Also look at the different types of lenders you may borrow with. Some people may feel comfortable with an online lender, while others may prefer a credit union or bank. You'll also want to make sure you're able to select a term length that works for you and that your loan's purpose is allowed by the lender you choose. Guides like this one will help you compare multiple lenders in the same place to weigh their pros and cons. Keep in mind that you should also read individual reviews of any lenders you're considering. There's no one-size-fits pick for the best personal loan that will work for all borrowers. However, there are key features to focus on when making a decision. The most important are: APRs on personal loans can vary widely from one lender to another. The interest rate on your determines how much you'll ultimately repay. Even a relatively small difference in the interest rate can add thousands of dollars over the life of your loan. The term of a personal loan, or the period of time you have to repay it, determines how high or low your monthly payment will be. A longer term will mean a lower payment, but you'll pay in total interest. A shorter term will come with a higher payment and ultimately less overall interest. The best personal loan lenders offer a wide range of terms to choose from. Whether you're interested in taking out a$5,000 loanor a$40,000 loan, finding the right provider can help with your loan approval experience. The Better Business Bureau, a non-profit organization focused on consumer protection and trust, evaluates businesses using factors like their responsiveness to consumer complaints, honesty in advertising, and clarity about business practices. Here is each company's score: All of our top picks, minus Wells Fargo, are rated A or higher by the BBB. Keep in mind that a high BBB score does not ensure a positive relationship with a lender, and that you should keep doing research and talking to others who have used the company to get the most comprehensive information possible. The BBB gives Wells Fargo an F rating because of the business' failure to respond to 27 complaints and government actions against the business. Most recently, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in December 2022 ordered Wells Fargo to return $2 billion to customers and pay a $1.7 billion penalty for legal violations involving auto loans, mortgages, and deposit accounts. The bank illegally charged fees and interest penalties on auto and mortgage loans. Additionally, it misapplied payments to those loans for many customers. If this history makes you uncomfortable, you may consider using one of the other personal loan lenders on our list. We consulted personal loan and financial experts to give their insights into finding the best loan companies for your needs. ""The interest rate on a personal loan is the price you pay for borrowing the loan. This rate can make a massive difference in the total amount paid over time, so ensuring you have the lowest interest rate available saves you money!"" ""Depending on the interest rate you're charged, you could end up paying hundreds or thousands of dollars more than a borrower with better credit who takes out a similar amount of money."" ""The first step is to pull a copy of your credit report from TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian. All you have to do is go to www.annualcreditreport.com. After you pull your credit reports, go through them to identify what could be holding you back from qualifying for a better rate. Some of the information on your credit report is used to generate your credit score, which is used when determining if youqualify for a loanand what your interest rate should be. The five sections used to calculate your credit score are your payment history, credit utilization, length of payment history, mix of accounts, and new accounts or inquiries."" ""The best way to get a lower rate is to improve your credit history. You can do so by making on time, reliable payments and managing the amount of debt you take out compared to your overall limit."" Generally,lenders require a credit scorein the mid-600s to qualify for a personal loan, though some will lend to borrowers with lower credit scores.To get a loan with bad credit, you might also want to considercredit unions offering personal loansand secured loans. In theory, you can have an unlimited number of personal loans. But the total number you'll actually be able to get will depend on how many you can qualify for. Your chances of qualifying for a loan will decrease with each loan you take out as yourdebt-to-income ratioincreases. The time it takes to get the proceeds from a personal loan depends on the lender. Most fund them in a week or less after you are approved. Thebest quick personal loan companiescan get you your money either the same day or the next day. The easiest personal loans to get approved for tend to be those with the most lenient credit score requirements. However, even thebest loans for bad creditthat you can get are likely to come with high interest rates. Alternatives to personal loans include0% APR credit cards,which can be used to consolidate credit card debt or make purchases that you'd like to pay off over time, andhome equity lines of credit, which can fund major repairs or renovations usually at lower interest rates.

Best debt consolidation loans,"Debt consolidationis when you take out one loan and use it to pay off other debts that you have, leaving you with one monthly payment and interest rate.

However, this lender only works with borrowers with good or better credit, with a minimum credit score requirement of 660. LightStream offers consistentlylow personal loan interest rates, though its minimum interest rate for debt consolidation is higher than its typical personal loan's interest rates. However, this lender does not have any prepayment or origination fees. Same-day funding is available with LightStream. Although Lighstream offers high maximum loan amount limits, only borrowers with excellent credit can borrow the $100,000 maximum, and anyone without excellent credit may not qualify for the full amount. LightStream defines excellent credit as an account with five or more years of credit history, stable and sufficient income for debts, and a variety of credit history with little or no credit card debt. If you're looking for a debt consolidation loan, chances are you have a significant amount of debt, and may not fit these qualifications. Additionally, LightStream doesn't have a way to pre-qualify online. You'll have to apply for the loan to find out exactly what your rates and terms could look like, which could make comparison shopping difficult. LightStream Personal Loan review Upgrade is one of the best companies to consolidate debt because it is great for fast cash. This lender allows you to get your money within one business day after your loan is reviewed and approved. You're also able to get a loan for as little as $1,000, which is less than many of the other competitors on our list. It could be a good choice if you only have a small amount of debt you need to consolidate. Be aware that Upgrade does charges origination and late fees. You could pay a late fee of up to $10 if you don't make a full payment within 15 days of your due date. ASoFipersonal loan is the best option for anyone with a high balance, as this lender makes debt consolidation loans of $5,000 to $100,000.

Similarly, SoFi doesn't have any application or prepayment fees as well as doesn't require an origination fee. SoFi student loans have stringent eligibility requirements. SoFi personal loans have a minimum credit score of 680. According to NerdWallet, the average income among borrowers is over $100,000. Getting a loan with bad credit, whether to consolidate debt or for something else, can be expensive, or hard to qualify for. An Avant personal loan is the best bet for borrowers with poor credit, requiring a minimum credit score of 600. Compared with other personal loan lenders offering debt consolidation loans for bad credit borrowers, Avant's terms are the most generous. While there is an administration fee, it could be lower than competitors' fees with a cap up to 4.75% in administration fees with an undisclosed late fee and returned payment fee. Avant also has the advantage of offeringfast personal loan funding. While Avant is accessible to borrowers with poor credit scores, approval might go hand in hand with high interest rates on your loan. Additionally, borrowers may face origination fees and limited loan amounts compared to other lenders. In the fair credit range, it can be tough to qualify for a personal loan with reasonable interest rates — many lenders have a minimum of 660 or 680. However, a Happy Money Payoff Loan™ could be a good option for people with credit scores as low as 640. Interest rates are comparable to those offered by LightStream and SoFi, but this lender has less stringent requirements. Compared with competitorsProsperandBest Egg, which both have the same 640 minimum credit score requirement, Payoff's interest rates are capped lower, and could have lower origination fees. Payoff offers loans with a 0% to 5% origination fee. Competing lenders Prosper and Best Egg charge 1.00% to 9.99% and 0.99% and 9.99% origination fees, respectively. The better deal will depend on your credit score, income, and repayment term. Happy Money Personal Loan review Flexibility makesWells Fargopersonal loans  a top contender for one of the best banks for debt consolidation. Wells Fargo separates debt consolidation loans from personal loans, but the interest rates are the same. Benefits include competitive interest rates and an autopay discount of 0.25% if payments are made from a Wells Fargo account. For unsecured personal loans, the most common type for debt consolidation, there are no origination or prepayment fees. Wells Fargo can send your loan funds to your Wells Fargo bank account, or to a credit account outside of Wells Fargo to pay down your debts directly. Consider Wells Fargo's history with data security and compliance. The bank has faced several federal penalties for improper customer referrals to lending and insurance products, and security issues tied to creating fake accounts several years ago. Wells Fargo Personal Loan review The BBB measures businesses based on factors like their responsiveness to customer complaints, honesty in advertising, and transparency about business practices. We've compared each institution's Better Business Bureau score to give you another piece of information to choose your lender. Whether you're considering a$5,000 loanor a$10,000 loan, a trustworthy lender can improve your loan experience. With the exception of Wells Fargo, our top picks are rated A or higher by the BBB. Keep in mind that a high BBB score does not guarantee a positive relationship with a lender, and that you should continue to do research and talk to others who have used the company to get the most complete information possible. Wells Fargo is currently rated an F by the BBB due to government actions against the business and a failure to respond to 27 complaints. Most recently, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in December 2022 ordered Wells Fargo to return $2 billion to customers and pay a $1.7 billion penalty for legal violations involving auto loans, mortgages, and deposit accounts. The bank illegally charged fees and interest penalties on auto and mortgage loans. Additionally, it misapplied payments to those loans for many customers. If you're uncomfortable with this history, you may want to use one of the other personal loan lenders on our list. The main benefits of consolidating debt are streamlining your debts into a single account with one monthly payment and reducing the total amount of interest you'll owe. When shopping for a debt consolidation loan, look for an APR that is lower than the average you're paying on the debt you want to consolidate. If you can't qualify for a lower rate, a debt consolidation loan might not be a good choice for you. Also consider the loan amounts, associated fees and penalties, as well as a lender's credit score minimum and other eligibility requirements when choosing a debt consolidation loan. Qualifying for a debt consolidation loan is the same as it is for most other kinds of personal loans. Generally, lenders require acredit scorein the mid-600s, although some will accept borrowers with lower scores. Remember, though, that with a lower credit score, you'll pay a higher interest rate. In addition to checking your credit score, debt consolidation companies will also need proof of your employment and ability to repay in order to determine eligibility. They will also check yourdebt-to-income ratioto make sure you haven't borrowed more than you can feasibly pay back. Most lenders will allow you toprequalify for a loan, which allows you to compare interest rates and terms without affecting your credit score. After you've gotten prequalified with several lenders, compare their offers and choose the one that best suits your needs. To complete thefull loan application processyou'll need a significant amount of documentation, including things like: Get these basics in order before applying for the loan, in order to speed up the process. You can apply for most loans by filling out a form online. If you are approved, the lender will send you the final loan documents to sign off on. These include all the details such as the interest rate, the amount of time you have to pay it off, the amount you're borrowing, the monthly payments, and any fees. Make sure you fully understand all of it before signing for the loan. If you're looking for a debt consolidation loan because your credit cards carry high APRs, it's worth your time to consider some alternatives. One often underutilized strategy is to simply ask your credit card company for a lower rate. There's no guarantee that they'll agree. However, they may well do so, especially if you've been diligent about payments. You can also ask about upgrading your credit card, which may come with a lower APR and other perks. You may also be able to get a lower rate by transferring your balances to a different credit card. Cards designed for this purposeoften come with an introductory 0% APRperiod that can last anywhere from 12-18 months. Remember that you'll need to pay off your balance before the intro period ends to avoid being hit with high interest rates. Tackling your debt head-on using strategies such as theavalanche and snowball methodsis another alternative. The avalanche method prioritizes paying off debts with the highest interest rates first, saving you more money in the long run. Meanwhile, the snowball method focuses on eliminating smaller debts first, creating smaller wins that help maintain motivation.

Because personal loans are typically unsecured, they usually carry higher interest rates than secured lending options. However, if a person has a strong credit profile, a personal loan can carry a lower APR than other unsecured sources of financing such as credit cards."" ""One of the best ways to use a personal loan is to pay off other high-interest debts like credit card debts. Because you can often lock in lower rates than a revolving line of credit like a credit card it can be a smart decision for your finances and save you thousands in interest payments over time."" ""Whether or not to take a personal loan depends on if one can afford it. The purpose of the loan and the value that comes with it is of importance to note. In most cases, it is beneficial to use the loan to invest in a project that can bring extra income or savings."" ""Borrowers should carefully consider alternatives to personal loans before taking one out. Personal loans can come with high interest rates, especially for borrowers with poor credit. If you can't fit those monthly payments into your budget, steer clear of the loan."" Personal loans are the most common type of loan used for debt consolidation.

Best Loans for Bad Credit,"Business Insider's personal finance team compared thebest personal loansfor bad credit, and we'll cover our top picks below. Yourcredit scoreis a key factor in getting a personal loan. If it's too low, some lenders may decide you pose too great a risk and decline to lend you money. However, it may still be possible to qualify for a personal loan even if your credit isn't in the best shape. The best personal loans for bad credit can provide financial flexibility, allowing you to address needs like debt consolidation, unexpected expenses, or home repairs. Responsible repayment of these loans can also contribute to rebuilding your credit over time. Remember that even the best personal loans for low credit scores will come with higher interest rates compared with loans for borrowers with good credit. But they can be much safer than other alternatives often resorted to by those with bad credit, such aspayday loans, which have exorbitantly high interest rates and can trap you in a cycle of debt. Offers emergency, home improvement, and debt consolidation loans Avant Personal Loan is a good personal loan provider, especially if you have a lower credit score and need to receive your loan money quickly. Just be prepared to pay a high APR if you do have a low score. You can prepay your loan at any time with no fee or penalty $1,000 to $50,000 (borrowers in four states are subject to higher minimum loan amounts: Massachusetts: $7,000, Ohio: $6,000, New Mexico: $5,100, Georgia: $3,100) Upstart could be the right lender if you have a strong work and education history, but you have a low credit score or limited credit history. The best personal loan for you depends on your credit score, which will determine what you qualify for and can lower your rate. Offers debt consolidation loans. Low minimum credit score requirement. LendingPoint is a solid option if you need to get a loan with bad credit or you don't qualify for a loan with another lender. However, the range of loan amounts is more limited than what other lenders offer, and if you have good credit, you can likely get a better rate elsewhere. Upgrade offers a low minimum APR. But you'll likely pay a higher rate if your credit isn't in good shape. With a poor credit history, you may end up paying an APR closer to 35.99%. Upgrade's smallest loan amount of $1,000 is lower than many other comparable lenders. You'll pay anorigination feewith Upgrade, which will be taken from your loan proceeds. Upgrade may also charge you a late fee of up to $10. However, you won't pay any prepayment penalties with this lender. Once you accept your loan offer, you should get your funds as soon as the next business day. Get matched to personal loan offers, or read ourUpgrade Personal Loans review. Avant is one of the easier lenders to qualify for on our list. The lender states that the minimum credit score is just a guideline and not a requirement, but most Avant borrowers have a credit score between 600 and 700. Avant funds loans quickly — if the company approves your loan by 4:30 p.m. CT Monday through Friday, funds are often put into your account by the next business day. Avant has excellent customer service hours, with its phone line open at least 13 hours every day of the week. The lender also has a strong mobile app. Get matched to personal loan offers, or read ourAvant Personal Loans review. LendingPoint claims to look beyond your credit score, making it a good option if you can't qualify for other lenders with your credit score. LendingPoint has a quick application process, and you may be approved within one to three business days. You can often get your funds the next business day after approval. Unfortunately, you're not able to take out a loan if you live in Nevada or West Virginia. You also can expect to pay an origination fee of up to 10%, depending on the state you live in. Get matched to personal loan offers, or read ourLendingPoint Personal Loans review. Upstart has the lowest minimum credit score requirement of any of our top picks, at 300, but if your credit score is low, you might end up paying a high APR. However, Upstart also considers employment history and education history, such as where you went to school and your area of study, when making its lending decisions, which could help borrowers who may not qualify for a loan solely based on their credit score. Upstart's loan repayment term options are fairly limited — you can choose between a three-year or five-year term. On the bright side, the company usually funds loans within one business day, which is useful if you need your money fast. There are no prepayment penalties with this lender. Get matched to personal loan offers, or read ourUpstart Personal Loans review. LendingClub allows you to add acoborrowerto your loan application. So, if you're worried about not qualifying for a loan or paying a higher interest rate than you can afford, you may consider this option. However, it will take a few business days to get your money, which is longer than most of the other lenders on our list. You'll also pay an late fee of 5% of the minimum payment amount or $15 (whichever is greater) of your total loan amount. Get matched to personal loan offers, or read ourLendingClub Personal Loans review. OneMain Financial's minimum APR is higher than every other lender on our top picks, but there is no minimum credit score required to apply. If your credit is in particularly rough shape, it may be easier to qualify for a loan with this lender. You may also be able to get your money the same day you apply. OneMain's standout feature is that it offerssecured personal loans(loans backed by collateral such as a house or a car) as well as unsecured personal loans. This is uncommon among personal loan lenders. Get matched to personal loan offers, or read ourOneMain Financial Personal Loans review. If you're looking for a personal loan and have bad credit, you'll want to stick to lenders that allow you toprequalify for a loan. This allows you to compare interest rates and terms available without affecting your credit score. This is usually a fast process, so you should do so with several lenders. After you've prequalified, compare the offers and choose the one that best suits your needs. To complete thefull loan application processyou'll need documentation, including paperwork like: If you're approved for the loan, the lender will send you the final loan documents to sign off on. Make sure to read everything carefully to understand exactly how much you'll be paying in total for the loan, and be absolutely certain you can afford the monthly payments. Some lenders offer financial tools and resources, such as a loan calculator, to help you determine if loan payments will fit into your budget. Whether you're looking for a$5,000 loanor a$10,000 loan, finding a trustworthy lender can help improve your loan experience. To help you make a decision, we've compared each institution's Better Business Bureau score. The BBB measures businesses based on factors like their responsiveness to consumer complaints, truthfulness in advertising, and clarity about business practices. Here is each company's score: All of our top picks are rated A- or higher by the BBB. Keep in mind that a high BBB score does not guarantee a positive relationship with a lender and that you should continue to do research and talk to others who have used the company to get the most comprehensive information possible. Some personal loan lenders, such as Best Egg and OneMain, may accept collateral for a secured loan, which may get you a lower interest rate. However, most lenders focus on unsecured loans, which are based entirely on your creditworthiness. Secured loans may get you a lower interest rate, but it's important to remember that you risk losing your collateral if you end up in a position where you can't afford the monthly payments. This can be financially devastating if you were to put up your car as collateral. Another bad credit loan alternative worth considering is a joint personal loan or coborrower loan. This means that you find someone to take out the loan with you (ideally with a better credit score). The main benefit of having a co-borrower is that you may qualify for better loan terms because both your credit scores and income will be taken into account during the loan application process. The drawback to this type of loan is that both you and your coborrower will be negatively affected if you fail to repay the loan. It's important to watch out for predatory lenders that target borrowers with bad credit with loans at exorbitant interest rates that can trap you in a cycle of debt. A common red flag is when a lender pressures you to ""act immediately."" A reputable lender understands that the decision to take out a personal loan requires time. Cash advances and payday loansare among the most frequently seen examples. They're advertised as fast and helpful ways to get money to cover an unexpected expense without requiring a credit check. However, these borrowing methods often end up saddling borrowers with loan terms and interest rates that severely damage their long-term financial health. Car title loans, which allow the lender to take ownership of your car if you can't pay, are also frequently associated withpredatory lending. Getting a personal loan with bad credit can help you improve your credit score. While it may sound counterintuitive, there are several ways this can happen based on how credit scores are calculated. For example, when you make payments on a loan, they're reported to the majorcredit bureaus. Your payment history accounts for more than a third of your overall credit score, so making your payments on time will have a positive impact. If you use apersonal loan for debt consolidation, it can also help improve your score. With a debt consolidation loan for poor credit, you roll multiple debts into a single loan with one monthly payment. This can reduce yourcredit utilization ratio, which determines about 30% of your credit score. To get the best personal loan for bad credit scores, consider what is most important to you. Many borrowers prioritize thelowest personal loan interest ratebut also consider any fees, the minimum credit score needed, and the accessibility of the lender's customer service. You'll also want to make sure you're able to select a term length that works for you and that your loan's purpose is allowed by the lender you choose. Depending on your situation, you might also look for loans for bad credit with instant approval so you can get the funds as soon as possible. See the latestpersonal loan interest rates» For bad or poor credit loans specifically, you'll want to understand if you qualify for a loan or if you may need to add a cosigner to boost your chances of being eligible. Each personal loan we review has a numerical rating on a 1-5 scale. This rating is a weighted average taking into account several important criteria for choosing the best loan for you: interest rates, fees, term lengths, funding speed, and more. Each category's weighting is based on its importance to your borrowing experience. Rates and fees have the most direct impact on the overall cost of your loan, so we weigh those the most heavily. See ourpersonal loan rating methodologypage to learn more. Toget a loan with bad credit, your best bet and easiest option is one that is either secured with collateral or one in which you have a more creditworthy borrower cosign with you. That way, the lender will have less risk of not getting its money back. Personal loans for bad credit with a reputable lender are safe. Search for personal loans that are backed by aMember FDIC bankor NCUA-accredited credit union. Also, familiarize yourself withcommon personal loan scamsso you know how to avoid them. There is no such thing as a personal loan with guaranteed approval, and it's important to be cautious of such claims. No legitimate lender can guarantee you'll be approved for a personal loan, especially if you have bad credit. You can get a loan online even if you have bad credit. Lenders including Avant, LendingPoint, and Upgrade, are among those that offer bad credit loans online. Some lenders, such as Upstart, claim that you only need a credit score of 300 to receive a loan. However, most lenders require a credit score of around 600 to qualify for a bad credit loan.

What to watch out for:Ascent limits borrowers' total loans to $400,000, including any other federal or private student loans outside of Ascent. Regular Annual Percentage Rate (APR):4.99% - 14.63% variable and 3.39% - 15.13% fixed (with AutoPay discount, varies by plan) Loan Amount Range:$2,001 - $200,000 ($200,000 aggregate total) Learn more atAscent Undergraduate Student Loans. Earnest's private student loans offer low starting interest rates and very flexible repayment terms. Earnest has four options for repayment, including a nine-month deferral after school. Earnest doesn't charge any fees, including prepayment or origination fees on private student loans, which makes it a strong option. Earnest also advertises the ability to skip a payment once per year. But that doesn't mean that you're off the hook for that payment since interest will still add up, and your payoff will be delayed. Your payments could be higher if you take full advantage of these features, and they could increase your total payoff time and loan amount. But if used the right way, Earnest's private student loans could still beat the competition with such low starting interest rates. What to watch out for:Some of Earnest's flexible features aren't the right fit for everyone. The ability to delay loans for nine months may not be as great as it sounds, since interest still accrues during this period, growing your loan's balance. Regular Annual Percentage Rate (APR):4.99% - 16.85% variable and 3.47% - 16.49% fixed (with AutoPay discount) Loan Amount Range:$1,000 - 100% of education cost Learn more atEarnest Undergraduate Student Loans. Custom Choice offers loans of up to $99,999 annually that come without fees, and you can check your rates within a few minutes. Custom Choice also offers a 2% reduction on your loan principal after you provide the lender with proof of graduation, as well as a .25% interest rate reduction when you sign up for AutoPay. What to watch out for:No mobile app. If you want to manage your loans on the go, you won't be able to with Custom Choice. Regular Annual Percentage Rate (APR):4.45% - 14.08% variable and 4.24% - 14.02% fixed Loan Amount Range:$1,000 - $99,999 Custom Choice Student Loans Review MPower Financing offers fixed loans designed for international students. You can get a loan without a cosigner, collateral, or US credit history. Most other lenders that offer loans to international students require a US citizen or permanent resident to cosign on the loan. What to watch out for:High interest rates. While the lender's starting interest rates are higher than many of the other lenders on this list, we included it because of its accessibility for international students. Regular Annual Percentage Rate (APR):13.74% to 14.75% fixed (with AutoPay discount) Fees:5% origination fee and undisclosed late fee Loan Amount Range:$2,001 — $100,000 lifetime MPower Financing Student Loans Review Private student loans are educational loans offered by private companies. Any student loan that isn't offered through the federal government is considered a private student loan. Unlike federal student loans, which are issued by the government, private student loans are issued by private lending companies and don't offer as many opportunities for loan forgiveness. Take the federal student loan forbearance offered by the government during the coronavirus pandemic. While private lenders may have offered their own help for people experiencing hardships, private student loan borrowers didn't get that widespread benefit or keep interest rates at 0%. While federal student loans have fixed interest rates, private loans can have fixed or variable rates, and they're typically higher than federal rates. Private student loans generally offer fewer options for repayment. If you need student loans to afford college, you should start by exploring your federal loan options by completing theFAFSA(Free Application for Federal Student Aid). Since federal loans usually have more favorable terms, prioritize these before private student loans. We've only selected private student loan lenders with no public controversies in the last three years. We've also compared each institution's Better Business Bureau score. The BBB, a non-profit organization focused on consumer protection and trust, evaluates companies by judging a business's responses to consumer complaints, honesty in advertising, and clarity about business practices. Here is each company's score: Of our top picks, only Ascent and Custom Choice are not currently A or higher by the BBB. Custom Choice isn't rated by the BBB at all, and Ascent has a B rating due to 19 complaints filed against the business. Customer experience can vary widely, so this doesn't necessarily reflect Ascent or Custom Choice's trustworthiness overall. You should ask others about their experiences with the businesses before deciding against borrowing from the companies. When shopping for a private student loan, the main factors you'll be comparing across lenders are: Remember that the best private student loan for you will depend on your credit score, with higher credit scores generally qualifying for lower interest rates. Pay close attention to term lengths, too, since shorter term lengths will entail larger monthly payments. This is a great way to save on interest, but you'll need to evaluate your budget to see whether you can afford it. Make sure to compare offers with several lenders before making a final decision. Unlike federal student loans, which require filling out the FAFSA, you can apply for private student loans directly through a given lender. But you'll need to make sure you're eligible to apply first. Generally, to get a private student loan, you must: To apply for a private student loan, you'll typically need to provide the following: You can apply for a private student loan via a lender's website. Navigate to the application section, where you'll be asked to fill in information such as the items above. After you complete the initial application, you'll generally see your prequalified rates and an approval decision. The results will generally include various options with a range of monthly payments. From there, choose the option that works best for you, and sign the paperwork. Once you officially sign the paperwork for the loan, your funds will arrive within a matter of days or weeks. The most obvious alternative to getting a private student loan is getting a federal student loan. Not only do federal loans offer more protections when it comes to loan forbearance, forgiveness, and deferment, but they also tend to have lower interest rates than private loans. You should always pursue your federal student loan options before looking into private lenders. Loans aren't your only option for getting money to fund your education. You should also explore any scholarship and grant opportunities available to you. The advantage with these is that you won't be required to pay back the money you receive. Under the umbrella of scholarships and grants, there are two main categories. The first isneed-based financial aid, which is awarded based on your family's financial situation compared to the cost of attendance for your desired school. The second category ismerit-based scholarships and grants. As the name implies, these scholarships are awarded to those who meet certain academic or athletic standards, such as having a high GPA or achieving success with one or more sports. Even if you don't think you'll qualify for any grants or scholarships to cover your education, you should explore your options. It's worth applying, since that money won't need to repaid. Work-study programsprovide part-time jobs, generally on campus, to students with financial need. Students can use the funds to pay for tuition, books, and other living expenses. To be eligible for work-study, you'll need to submit the FAFSA and demonstrate financial need. Students can apply for a private student loan either on their own or with a co-signer. The private student loan application process usually requires a credit check, so if you don't have an established credit history, you may need a co-signer to qualify. Private student loan interest rates can be either fixed or variable. The higher your credit score, the lower your rate should be. Whether or not it's a good idea to take out a private student loan depends on your unique financial situation. You may consider alternatives such as a less expensive school, scholarships, or a side job to earn more money. Whatever your decision is, make sure you understand the terms of your loan before making a choice. While private student loan repayment options vary from lender to lender, in general the options include immediate repayment, interest-only payments while you're in school, and defering payments until after you graduate. Federal student loans have a number of protections that private student loans don't, for instance, the widespread forbearance during the pandemic.Income-based repayment plansare also only available for federal student loans. Be sure to use all your available federal loan options first to take advantage of these protections. We rate all student loan products in our reviews and guides on a 1-5 scale. The overall rating is a weighted average that takes into account seven different categories, some of which are judged more heavily than others. They are: Each category's weighting is determined based on its importance to your borrowing experience. Rates and fees have the most significant impact on the total cost of your loan, so we weigh those the most heavily. Customer support and ethics are still crucial parts of the borrowing experience, but they are not directly tied to a student loan's terms, so they have less of an impact on the overall rating.

Best Student Loan Refinance,"There are many reasons you may want to refinance your student loans. Perhaps you're looking to pay less interest, switch from a variable-rate to a fixed-rate loan, or change your payment term length. The top student loan refinance companies offer a variety of terms and low interest rates. But keep in mind that refinanced student loans are always issued byprivate student loan lenders—so if you originally had a federal student loan, refinancing means you'll lose some key benefits. If your original loan was from a private lender, though, you may have nothing to lose by refinancing. 0.25% discount on regular rates with AutoPay 5.88% - 9.99% variable and 4.29% - 9.89% fixed (with AutoPay discount) Earnest is a strong lender with competitive rates and a variety of term lengths. If you fall on financial hardship, you can skip a payment once per year — though that payment will extend the length of your loan term later. 0.25% AutoPay interest rate discount and a 0.125% SoFi Plus Discount rate discount Variable: 5.99% - 9.99%, Fixed: 4.49% - 9.99% (with all discounts) SoFi is an excellent lender for borrowers who want competitive APRs and for those who don't want to worry about fees. 0.25% discount on regular rates with AutoPay 6.99% - 13.99% variable and 6.99% - 13.99% fixed (with AutoPay discount, varies by program) Late fee of $25 or 5% of payment, whichever is less College Ave is a great lender for borrowers who want multiple options for repayment term lengths and are after a low APR. College Ave also offers many options for contacting customer support. Earnest has some of the most competitive starting rates of any of the best lenders on our list, so if you haveexcellent credit, it could be a good choice for you. Like Earnest's undergraduate and graduate new loans, its refinanced loans have a special perk: the ability to skip one payment every year. You can ask for your first skip once you've made at least six months of consecutive on-time, full principal and interest payments, as long as your loan is in good standing. However, interest will accrue during this time, and the lender will extend the final payoff date of your loan by the length of the skipped payment period. One thing to watch out for is that this lender has higher maximum interest rates. While Earnest eagerly shares its minimum rates, the company doesn't disclose those on the maximum end anywhere. If you have a shakier credit history, you may end up paying more interest than you initially expected. SoFi is an excellent option for refinancing student loans because this lender does not charge anyorigination fees, late fees, or prepayment penalties. SoFi will let you check what rates they qualify for in as little as two minutes with a convenient online prequalification tool that won't hurt your credit score. Borrowers should be aware that SoFi advertises low interest rates; however, these rates are only available to consumers with great credit who set up autopay and the SoFi Plus Discount. PenFed offers the lowest maximum fixed refinance rates of any lender on our list. If you have poorer credit and are still able to qualify for a PenFed refinanced loan, you might get a better deal with it than elsewhere. You need to be a member of the credit union to get your loan. If you've served in the military or work at qualifying associations or organizations, you'll qualify. If that doesn't apply, you can easily join by opening a savings account with a $5 minimum deposit. PenFed doesn't offer variable-rate loans, which often start at lower rates than fixed-rate loans — although they can overtake fixed loan rates over time. If you want a variable loan, you won't be able to get one with PenFed. Laurel Road offers some of the best fixed rates of all of our lenders, but keep in mind that only 11% of applicants who applied between July 2019 and June 2021 qualified for Laurel Road's top rate, according to the company's website. Don't bank on getting it unless you have excellent credit. If you sign up for aLaurel Road checking account, you'll receive an interest rate discount on your refinanced loan. You can redeem 2x cash back toward student loan payments with theLaurel Road Student Loan Cash Back credit card. Borrowers need to watch out for late fees with this lender. Laurel Road's late fee is $38 or 5% of your payment, whichever is less. If you fall behind on payments, the total cost of your loan will add up. Laurel Road Student Loan Review Splash Financial is a student loan marketplace, not a direct lender. A marketplace allows you to compare loan offers from multiple lenders at once. The marketplace allows you to check your rates with no impact on your credit score. As a result, it's tricky to nail down the exact terms you'll receive with Splash Financial. For instance, some of the company's lending partners have no maximum amount you can refinance, while others have a cap. You may like Splash Financial if you want to compare a bunch of different companies all at once with one application. You should also keep in mind that Splash Financial doesn't underwrite its own loans. As a result, you'll be dealing with whatever partner lender you choose and may have a different experience with them managing your loan than the one you expected. Splash Financial Student Loan Review Citizens Bank's top loan amount of $750,000 for professional degrees is the highest of any lender we compiled that discloses a maximum loan amount. Citizens Bank is also the only brick-and-mortar bank we have listed, which may be a good option for those who are more comfortable with traditional banking. Citizens Bank's minimum of $10,000 is also the highest of any lender on our list. So, if you have a small amount of debt, another lender is probably a better fit for you. Citizens Bank Student Loan Review LendKey is a marketplace, not a direct lender. A student loan marketplace allows you to compare loan offers from multiple lenders at once. The marketplace allows you to check your rates with no impact on your credit score. LendKey partners withcredit unionsand community banks, so you may get a more personalized level of service than you would with a Splash Financial marketplace partner. As a borrower, you should know that LendKey has the lowest maximum refinance amount of any of the best lenders on the list. This probably won't be an issue unless you have a significant amount of loan debt. LendKey Student Loan Marketplace Review College Ave offers 11 repayment term lengths, making it among the most flexible student loan lenders with regard to loan terms. You're able to take out a loan for five to 15 years with College Ave. Many other lenders limit your selection to four or five options — though some others do offer 20-year term lengths (which College Ave does not). You should look out for College Ave's lower maximum refinancing amount. If you have a truly significant amount of debt (we're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars), you may not be able to refinance all your debt with College Ave. This won't be the case for the vast majority of borrowers, but it bears noting. College Ave Student Loan Review Student loan refinancing is when a private lender repays your existing student loans and then gives you a single new loan to replace them. Depending on your credit score and income, your new loan could come with a lower interest rate, saving you money over the life of the loan. You can also choose new repayment terms, usually within 5-20 years. With student loan financing, a private lender always provides your new loan – whether the existing student loans are federal or private. This makes student loan refinancing different fromstudent loan consolidation. For instance, with student loan consolidation, multiple federal student loans can be combined into a single federal student loan. Before you consider refinancing a student loan, know thatprivate student loans— which all refinanced loans are — are not eligible for the same protections and benefits as federal student loans. These include opportunities for loan forgiveness and more flexibility with repayments. Refinancing student loans can help you save money and simplify your finances. Your refinanced student loan could have a lower interest rate than your current loan — especially if you have good credit and a decent income. That means you'll pay less in interest as you repay the loan. A refinanced student loan also allows you to replace multiple student loans with a single loan. That means you'll be responsible for making just one monthly payment, which could relieve financial stress and help you avoid missing payments. The difference betweenstudent loan refinancing and consolidationcan be confusing, especially because people sometimes use the terms interchangeably. However, these are two different processes, and depending on your financial goals, one may be better for you than the other. Student loan refinancinginvolves restructuring your current loan or loans and getting a new one with updated terms. You'll make a single monthly payment. You can refinance private and federal loans into one combined loan. When you refinance federal loans with a private lender, you'll lose some key borrower protections. Consolidation is the process of combining multiple loans into one. You'll make a single monthly payment after consolidation. When you consolidate loans, your new loan consolidation rate is the weighted average of your old loans' rates, rounded up to the nearest eighth of a percent. If you can get a lower interest rate on your loan, it might pay off to refinance. It could also be worth refinancing your student loan if you have a variable interest rate that's gone up significantly and you want a fixed interest rate so you have predictable payments. However, federal loans have some unique benefits, so only refinance after assessing all of your options. You don't have anything to lose by refinancing a private loan if you can get a better rate and save money. You won't forgo any federal protections such as income-driven repayment plans,  deferment, or forbearance. If you're unsure if refinancing makes sense for you, it's worth using a student loan refinance calculator to see how much you could save. You'll input your current loan terms, along with the terms of the loan you're considering refinancing into, and the calculator will show you both your monthly savings and your potential savings over the lifetime of the new loan. Lenders consider several factors when deciding whether you qualify for student loan refinancing. Your credit score significantly impacts your eligibility to refinance a student loan. You canraise your credit scoreby paying your bills on time, paying off existing debt, and requesting higher credit limits from your credit card company. Income and yourdebt-to-income (DTI) ratioare also important factors. That means earning a raise, getting a higher-paying job, and paying off debts could help you qualify. The lower your debt-to-income ratio, the better. If you still don't qualify, you can consider applying with acosigner. Here are the steps to refinance student loans: Don't just go with the first refinance option you come across; the best student loan refinance company for you will depend on what you're looking for and details like your credit score and existing loan terms. If your main goal in refinancing your student loan is lowering your interest rate, compare the rates you qualify for with several lenders to find the lowest option. Note that the higher your credit score, the better the rates you'll generally be offered. In this guide, we highlight the standout features of our top refinance picks. This can be a good starting place to evaluate what matters most to you. Beyond finding the lowest interest rate, you might look for refinance lenders without fees, lenders with the widest variety of repayment terms, or companies with brick-and-mortar locations so you can visit and discuss your options in person. The Better Business Bureau, a non-profit organization focused on consumer protection and trust, measures businesses using information like their responsiveness to consumer complaints, truthfulness in advertising, and transparency about business practices. Here is each company's score: All of our picks are rated A or higher by the BBB, with the exception of Laurel Road, but its parent company, KeyBank, has an A+ rating. It's important to note that a good BBB grade doesn't guarantee you'll have a good relationship with your lender, nor does a bad BBB grade mean you'll have a bad experience. Read online customer reviews or ask family and friends about their firsthand experience with the company before signing on the dotted line. Laurel Road has the lowest rates of any of our best student loan refinance lenders — though you'll only qualify for the best rates with a great credit score.

You also won't be eligible for specific repayment options likeincome-driven repayment plans, which take your specific income and family size into account when determining monthly payments.

If you qualify for a refinanced student loan with a significantly lower interest rate, you could end up saving thousands of dollars. No, refinancing student loans doesn't hurt your credit in the long term if you stay on top of payments. When you apply for student loan refinancing, the lender will conduct a hard credit check. This can cause a temporary decrease in your credit score. However, if you consistently make on-time loan payments, the refinancing should ultimately positively affect your credit. Business Insider's personal finance experts aim to help you make the best, most informed decisions with your money.

Best mortgage lenders,"Not all mortgage lenders are alike. Shopping around and comparingcurrent mortgage ratesfrom multiple lenders can help borrowers save money on their monthly mortgage payments and ensure they have a good experience buying or refinancing a home. To find the best mortgage lenders of 2025, we looked for lenders that have low rates and fees, rank high in customer satisfaction, and offer a good variety of loan types. The best lenders also have features that make their loans more affordable, likedown payment assistanceor flexible credit requirements. To make your search for the best lender easier, Business Insider has picked mortgage lenders that are affordable, thrive in customer satisfaction, and offer a variety oftypes of mortgagesto meet different borrowers' needs. Here are the best mortgage lenders of 2025 according to Business Insider editors. Bank of America has some of the lowest average rates and fees, according to the latestHome Mortgage Disclosure Act data. It also ranked high in customer satisfaction in 2024, according toJ.D. Power's Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study. Bank of America has robust offerings for lower-income borrowers. With this lender, you could get up to $7,500 in closing cost assistance and up to $10,000 in down payment assistance. If you already have an account with Bank of America, you may be able to get a discount on yourorigination fee. The lender's Community Affordable Loan Solution is an extremely affordable mortgage aimed at first-time homebuyers. It requires no down payment, closing costs, or mortgage insurance and it has no minimum credit score requirement. What to look out for:To qualify for Bank of America's Community Affordable Loan Solution, you'll need to live in a ""designated market,"" which includes some historically Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Charlotte, Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles, and Miami. You'll also need to earn less than the program's income limits. Bank of America Mortgage Review Based on Business Insider's review of HMDA data, Better Mortgage borrowers enjoyed significantly lower rates in 2023 compared to many other lenders we've reviewed. In addition to its low rates, Better Mortgage offers features that make it a convenient option, including a tool that lets you compare rates based on your ZIP code and a quick online application process. Better's fees are also around average, so you shouldn't pay a lot in closing costs to get a good rate with this lender. What to look out for:Better's loan offerings are relatively limited compared to some of the other lenders included on this list. Rocket Mortgage offers a quick, easy online experience and has mortgages with terms as short as eight years — making it a particularly good choice for those who are refinancing, because you can pick the exact term length you need. Most lenders only offer a small couple of term options, such as 15-year and 30-year refinances. Rocket also has a track record of providing great customer service, ranking high for customer satisfaction in J.D. Power's 2024 satisfaction study. Rocket offers a few different affordable mortgage options, including its ONE+ mortgage, which combines a 1% down payment with a 2% grant from the lender. If you don't have a ton of cash saved for your down payment, you might be able to take advantage of this program from Rocket. The lender also has anew program called RocketRentRewardsthat offers up to $5,000 in closing cost assistance to renters. What to look out for:Its loan options are relatively limited, and it doesn't have any in-person branches. You'll also need to earn 80% or less of thearea median incometo qualify for a ONE+ mortgage. Rocket's rates and fees are around average compared to other lenders, according to HMDA data. Guild Mortgage frequently ranks on our ""best of"" mortgage guides, thanks to its huge variety of mortgage offerings. Borrowers can get a mortgage from this lender using non-traditional credit, such as rent payment history, if they don't have a traditional credit score. Guild also offers a hybrid digital closing option. What to look out for:Guild doesn't display any rates online, making it difficult to get an idea of exactly how affordable this lender it. In our review of the latest HMDA data, Guild's rates and fees were around average compared to other lenders. It also ranked low in J.D. Power's 2024 mortgage origination satisfaction study. Third Federal Savings and Loan offers a wide range of unique benefits to its mortgage borrowers, including low down payment mortgages with no PMI and generous down payment assistance offerings. This lender also offers a Low Cost Mortgage option where you pay only $395 in closing costs — however, you will pay a slightly higher rate with this option. In our review of the latest HMDA data, we found that Third Federal had low average rates compared to other lenders. What to look out for:Third Federal is only available in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, and Washington, D.C. Its only physical branches are in Ohio and Florida. It also doesn't offer any government-backed mortgages. Third Federal Savings and Loan Mortgage Review CrossCountry Mortgage offers a wide range of mortgages, including more niche loan types for those in unique situations. In addition to its standard lineup, you can get manufactured home loans, foreign national loans, bank statement loans, and many other types of mortgages from this lender. Its CCM Smart Start and CCM Community Promise programs also offer down payment assistance for eligible borrowers. CrossCountry doesn't set a minimum credit score on its loans, and it will let you apply for some of its loans with non-traditional credit (like your rent payment history) if you don't have a credit score. What to look out for:CrossCountry Mortgage doesn't display any sample rates online. Through our review of HMDA data we found that this lender's rates and fees are around average. This lender ranks low in customer satisfaction according to J.D. Power. But it has many positive online customer reviews. To qualify for CCM Smart Start, you'll need to be a low-to-middle income first-time homebuyer. To qualify for CCM Community Promise, you'll need to live in an eligible metro area. Since everyone's circumstances are different, the right lender for you might not be the same lender that's right for someone else. In general, looking for lenders that have low average rates and fees while providing great customer service is a strong place to start. As you shop for a mortgage lender, consider both the rates you're offered as well as other costs you'll pay, including lender fees or discount points. Think about what additional features are important to you, too, such as an easy online application or other digital tools. Not every lender offers every type of mortgage. If you aren't sure what type is right for you, it might be worth talking to amortgage broker, who will have access to many different loan types from a variety of lenders. You'll want to apply for a mortgage with multiple lenders to get an idea of what's available to you. Many experts recommend getting quotes from at least three different lenders to be sure you're getting a good rate. You can getpreapprovedwith multiple lenders to compare rates, but you may get more accurate quotes once you have a signed purchase agreement. Adjustable-rate mortgagessometimes (but not always) have lower rates than fixed-rate mortgages. However, ARMs come with the risk that your rate can go up over time once the intro rate period is over. Make sure you're comparing apples to apples when you compare mortgage rates. This includes both ARMs vs.fixed-rate mortgagesas well as other types of mortgages. For example, government-backed mortgages often have lower rates than conventional loans. If you're buying a home, particularly if you're doing so for the first time, a mortgage lender with good customer service is vital. Home purchase contracts come with tight deadlines and consequences if those deadlines aren't met. You want to work with a lender that is efficient, easy to get ahold of if you need assistance or have questions, and is proactive about potential issues. Speed isn't as vital when you'rerefinancing, since you aren't working against a deadline. But it's still important to have a competent lender. Multiple lenders on this list rank high in customer satisfaction, including Rocket Mortgage and Bank of America. Many mortgage lenders now offer online applications and other services, even if they started as traditional brick-and-mortar lenders. But there can still be some differences between lenders that are only online and lenders with both an online and physical presence. Online-only lenders can sometimes be more affordable because they have fewer operational costs. But this isn't always the case. For example, Bank of America has low average rates and fees despite being a large financial institution with branches around the U.S. You might want to work with a traditional lender if you value in-person support or want to work with a loan officer who is local to you. As you search for the right lender, see which ones have branches near you. You might also want to consider going with a smaller, local lender or credit union. Because they're smaller and work with fewer clients, these institutions are often able to offer more personalized help and have better knowledge of your local real estate market and its norms. The best way to find the right fit for you is to apply with multiple lenders. That way, you can compare service, costs, and beneficial features before deciding which one you want to work with. Some mortgage lenders are better for certain borrowers or situations than others. For example, we think Rocket Mortgage is a good lender for refinancing because it offers the ability to customize your term length, which allows you to avoid resetting your loan term. In our guide to thebest mortgage lenders for first-time homebuyers, Bank of America was our top pick. A good lender for first-time buyers should offer loans and features specifically geared toward these borrowers. Look for lenders that have low-down-payment mortgages and offer additional help like down payment grants. We have guides to the best lenders for each of the three main types of government-backed mortgages. Lenders will ask for many differentdocuments when you apply for a mortgage, so it's a good idea to have them ready to go ahead of time. This will likely include paystubs, W-2s or 1099s, tax returns, bank statements and other asset account statements, and any other documentation showing your income and savings. Typically, the mortgage application process starts with a preapproval. With this kind of approval, the lender will take a look at your credit and finances and tell you how much it is willing to lend you based on the information it looked at. You'll use your preapproval to shop for homes and make offers. Once you have an offer accepted, you'll apply for approval. The lender may ask for more documentation at this stage, including a copy of your signed purchase contract. Once you're approved, you'll receive a loan estimate with all the details of your proposed mortgage, including estimated closing costs. If you decide to move forward, the lender will begin processing and underwriting your loan. It will order anappraisalto make sure the home is worth what you've agreed to pay for it, and underwriters will work to verify that you meet the lender's standards and can afford the loan. If all goes well, you'll receive final approval and be cleared to close. Our top pick mortgage lender is Bank of America, but that doesn't mean it's the best bank for you to get a mortgage from. The best mortgage lender for you is the one that you qualify with that offers the type of mortgage you're looking for and can give you the best deal in terms of its interest rates and fees. For the lender with the lowest mortgage rates, we recommend Better Mortgage based on its average rates in 2023, but you might find lower rates elsewhere depending on your individual financial situation. Take a look atBusiness Insider's daily mortgage rate updatesto see the average mortgage rates for various term lengths. The largest mortgage lender in America in 2023 was Rocket Mortgage, closely followed by United Wholesale Mortgage, according to a Consumer Financial Protection Bureauanalysisof Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data. Nonbank mortgage lenders sometimes are able to offer better rates because they have fewer operational costs compared to banks, but this isn't always the case. Banks also often offer benefits to existing customers who get a mortgage through them. Get preapproved with different types of lenders to see who can offer you the best overall deal. Yes, you can switch mortgage lenders before closing, and it may help you save if you find a better deal elsewhere. But this can cause closing delays or cost you money (if, for example, you need to get a new appraisal), so be sure to consider all the pros and cons. To help you learn more about homebuying, mortgages, and lenders, four experts weighed in: Here's their advice about how to evaluate mortgage lenders, and how to decide which type of mortgage is best for you. (Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.) What factors should someone take into consideration when choosing a mortgage lender? ""The canned answer is to just go with the lowest rate. However, you also want to take into account who's going to serve your loan best. Are repayments going to be easy for you? Who is most likely to be able to help you if you need to take out a HELOC or refinance later, versus somebody who's more of a one-off type? ""They may have the lowest rates to get you involved, but they might have very, very little hand holding after the fact. I wouldn't recommend paying an exorbitant amount more for potential services in the future, but just don't always necessarily go with the rock-bottom lowest rate. There's sometimes a cost with that."" ""Remember that you're not just choosing a mortgage lender — you're also building a homebuying team. To snag the home you want in this competitive market, you need a lender that can move quickly and has good communication with you and your real estate agent. When I was looking for a house, I was able to text my loan officer (whom my real estate agent recommended) and get quick replies when I had questions or needed an updated preapproval letter for an offer. As you compare lenders, pay attention to how responsive they are, and ask your agent if they have any experience with the lenders you're considering."" How can someone decide between a conventional mortgage vs. a government-backed mortgage? ""AnFHA mortgageis a really helpful option for borrowers with low scores or kind of rocky credit histories. But if you have great credit, you may get a better rate and pay less for mortgage insurance on a conventional mortgage. VA mortgagesare really great deals. If you qualify for one, you should definitely go for it. You get zero down with no mortgage insurance — plus some of the best rates available."" Julie Aragon, Aragon Lending Team: ""The most common government loan that's widely available to almost everyone is the FHA loan. There's a couple of reasons why somebody would go with FHA instead of conventional one. Their credit is a little on the crummy side, let's say below 700. You can get conventional with down to a 620 score, but the mortgage insurance gets really expensive. FHA doesn't discriminate — no matter how perfect or crappy your credit is, the mortgage insurance is the same."" How can someone know whether they're financially ready to buy a home? ""You should have funds left over after everything is said and done as it pertains to purchasing the home. So if you don't have anemergency fundplusa down payment, you're probably not ready to purchase a home. Another thing I think about is credit card debt. While you can be approved for a mortgage with credit card debt and student loans and very little cash on hand, you put yourself in a very risky situation."" ""You have to be ready to dedicate a chunk of your budget to homeownership — and I don't mean your mortgage payment. When you own your house, there's always something that needs taking care of, especially in the first year. We got to our new house on moving day to find that the A/C was out. We paid $700 to have it fixed."" Methodology: How Did We Choose the Best Mortgage Lenders? To choose the top mortgage lenders of March 2025, we looked at five main factors: See our full ratings methodology for mortgage lenders »",https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/best-mortgage-lenders
Best mortgage refinance lenders,"You might have different priorities when choosing a refinance lender than when you first got your mortgage. For example, a fast closing probably won't matter to you as much as getting the lowest rate possible. As you compare mortgage refinance lenders, be sure to consider your overall costs, including closing costs, in addition to your rate.

Carrington Mortgage Services Review The lenders on this list are affordable and have offerings that should meet most borrowers' needs, but ultimately it comes down to what rate you're offered and whether a given lender suits your needs. There are a few differentreasons to refinanceyour mortgage. Think about what you want to achieve with your refinance, and look for lenders that can meet those needs. Are you looking to do acash-out refinance? Do you want to change the type of mortgage you have? Is getting the lowest rate possible more important than having a good customer service experience? Make sure the lenders you're considering offer the type of refinance and level of service you want. Mortgage ratescan vary a lot between lenders, and your own financial situation will have a big impact on the range of rates available to you. You might be able to get a low rate with a specific lender, while another borrower can get a better rate elsewhere. The best way to know what rate you'll get with a lender is to apply for a mortgage. Experts typically recommend applying with at least three different lenders to be able to compare rates accurately. Though borrowers often start the refinancing process with the goal of getting the lowest rate possible, it's important to consider your overall costs. Some lenders offer low rates but charge a lot in fees or add discount points to lower the rate (which you'll pay for at closing). Refinancing can enable you to tap into your home's equity, lower your rate, get rid of mortgage insurance, extend or shorten your term, or change the type of mortgage you have. You'll need to meet the lender's credit requirements to qualify for a mortgage refinance, and having a greatcredit scorecan help you snag a better rate. The exception to this is if you're getting a streamline refinance, which is available ongovernment-backed mortgages. Some streamline transactions don't require the borrower to show a credit score. Right now, mortgage rates are still pretty high. However, if you initially got your mortgage in 2023 or 2024, current rates may be slightly lower than what you're paying. If that's the case, it's possible refinancing is worth it. You'll need to do some math to figure out if it makes sense financially to refinance. Because refinancing isn't free, you'll want to weigh the costs against the benefits. For example, if you're refinancing to lower yourmortgage payment, calculate how long it will take you to recoup your closing costs. If you spent $2,000 to refinance and lowered your monthly payment by $200, it would take 10 months of payments to break even. An online refinance calculator can help you figure out if refinancing is worth it. You don't have to get a mortgage with your current lender or bank, but you might find that it can offer you certain benefits or discounts as a returning customer. Big banks are well-established financial institutions that offer many other services besides mortgage lending. Although they sometimes have a reputation for not offering as much personalized support as smaller lenders, many of the big bank lenders we've reviewed rank high in customer satisfaction. Nonbank mortgage lenders that operate mostly online are a popular choice with tech-savvy borrowers. These lenders may offer lower rates since they don't have the same operational costs as lenders with physical footprints, but this isn't always the case. Smaller, local lenders are often able to offer better customer service than lenders that are working with a large number of borrowers. But you should compare their rates with some larger lenders to make sure they're competitive. Amortgage brokerwill do all the legwork of getting quotes from different mortgage lenders for you. If you want to be able to easily compare many different loan options, you might prefer working with a broker. Our top pick for refinancing is Rocket Mortgage, and we think it's a good choice if customer service and customizable terms are important to you. But ultimately the best company for refinancing depends on your needs and goals. You might prefer refinancing with your current lender if you like the customer service it offers and you value convenience. But shopping around and comparing rates for the type of loan you want (like a30-year mortgage refinance) gives you a chance to see what types of deals are available to you. There's no single lender that offers the best mortgage rates, since rates change every day and your rate will be based on your individual financial profile. Keep an eye on currentmortgage refinance ratesto see where rates are at right now, and compare that to the rates you're offered as you shop around for a lender. Nonbank mortgage companies can sometimes offer better rates and a speedier application process compared to traditional bank mortgage lenders, but this isn't always the case. It might not be a good idea to refinance unless you can lower your interest rate by a percentage point or more. A refinance calculator can help you decide if it's worth it to refinance or not. To help you learn more about refinancing and lenders, four experts weighed in: We consulted mortgage and financial experts to inform these picks and provide their insights about mortgage refinance lenders. Here's what they had to say about mortgage refinancing. (Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.) How can someone know whether it's a good time to refinance? Julie Aragon, Aragon Lending Team: ""The monthly savings and the cost for the refinance. When you have those two things, you can determine the break-even point. Also, how long they intend to stay in the house. If they know they're going to sell next year, it probably doesn't make sense to refinance."" ""A lot of times people don't realize refinancing comes with some additional costs. There's those closing costs, title costs, et cetera, that are tied into the overall fees. Simply getting a lower interest rate doesn't mean that you're saving money, is the biggest factor that a lot of people are not aware of."" What factors should someone take into consideration when choosing a mortgage refinance lender? ""I feel like with a refinance, you're going based on numbers a lot more than on your original mortgage. Probably because the mortgage feels like more of a weighty transaction, whereas with refinancing, you're kind of an old hand at it at this point. I think the numbers matter a lot more for a refinance."" ""You don't have the same time crunch during a refinance that you do when you're purchasing, so take your time to really evaluate the offers you're shown and don't rush into anything. Lenders are pros at making refinancing sound really attractive — even if it's not necessarily the best long-term financial move for you. Remember that their job is to sell you something, and your job is to make sure you're making the best decisions for your finances."" When is it a good idea to get a cash-out refinance? Julie Aragon, Aragon Lending Team: ""Investing the money into the home I think is always a good idea, as long as the math makes sense. Also paying off high-interest credit card debt. We have some clients, when we look at all of their debts, some are at 19% or 20%. By paying off all this crap, they'll save $1,500 or $2,000 a month."" ""I think it's a tough situation, because sometimes with cash-out refi is, you're thinking of things like credit card debt. This is the biggest one I hear from clients: I can get rid of this 23% interest that I have on my credit card debt, and I can put it in my 2% mortgage. Well, you just took something that was not tied to any collateral. They can't take your home away if you don't pay your credit card debt. So something that previously couldn't result in my home being in a way now can add to the stress of my home being taken away should I not be able to pay my mortgage.""

Best FHA Lenders,"For first-time homebuyers or borrowers with low credit scores or low income,FHA mortgagesoffer an affordable way to purchase a home. See the latest FHA interest rates to find out how much you could save on your monthly mortgage payment with one of these loans. Mortgage rates have been elevated recently. Fortunately, FHA rates are typically lower than rates for conventional mortgages. In February,30-year mortgage ratesfor FHA loans averaged around 5.92%, according toZillowdata. In recent weeks, rates have been trending slightly lower, and they may fall further this year. Here's howmortgage ratesare trending today. Because they're insured by a federal agency, interest rates on government-backed mortgages like FHA loans are typically lower thanconventional mortgagerates. Mortgage interest rates are determinedboth by larger economic factors as well as the borrower's individual financial profile, including their credit score,debt-to-income ratio (DTI), and down payment. The less risky you are as a borrower, the lower the rate you'll likely get. While you can't control the market trends that move mortgage rates, there may be things you can do with your credit and finances that can help you score a better FHA rate. Increasing your credit scoreand paying down debt to lower your DTI can make a big impact on the range of rates available to you. Saving up for a larger down payment can also help.

Power's origination satisfaction study. What to look out for:Fairway doesn't show sample rates online. Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation Review To choose the top FHA loan lenders, we looked at three main factors: An FHA loan is a type ofgovernment-backed mortgage. These home loans are offered by private lenders, but a federal agency (in this case, the Federal Housing Administration) provides insurance on the loans. If a home goes into foreclosure because of borrower default, the FHA insurance will pay to cover the lender's losses. Because of this insurance, FHA loans allow lower credit scores compared to othertypes of mortgagesand small down payments. Lenders are also able to offer better rates on these loans. To get an FHA loan, you'll usually need: If you put down 10%, you may be able to qualify with a credit score as low as 500. You may also be able to get an FHA loan with a higher DTI if you have compensating factors, such as cash reserves. This means that you have money in your bank account to cover your monthly mortgage payments should you suddenly lose your source of income. Coming up with adown paymentis a major hurdle for many hopeful homebuyers. But with an FHA loan, you only need to put down 3.5%. The FHA's more lenient credit requirements for its insured mortgages make buying a home more accessible to those with less-than-ideal credit or large amounts of debt. The lower rates that come with these loans are also beneficial for borrowers. But FHA loans do come with some additional costs that can make them more expensive for borrowers with great credit and large down payments. ""Generally, an FHA loan rate will be lower than a conventional loan rate,"" says Mason Whitehead, a Dallas-based branch manager forChurchill Mortgage. ""However, that can be a bit deceptive, because the closing costs and fees with FHA are much higher than on a standard, conventional loan."" FHA loans come with both upfront and annual mortgage insurance. The upfront mortgage insurance premium is equal to 1.75% of the loan amount. This fee can be paid at closing or financed into the loan amount. Your annual FHA mortgage insurance premium amount will be based on your loan amount,loan-to-value ratio, and term length. With a minimum down payment on a 30-year mortgage that's less than $726,200, you'll pay 0.55% of the loan amount each year. ""Monthly mortgage insurance with FHA is generally more expensive than with a conventional loan because it is a fixed rate no matter your credit score,"" says Whitehead. Our free mortgage calculator can help you compare monthly costs based on your down payment, interest rate, and the purchase price of the home. A 3.5% down payment is the lowest an FHA loan will allow, but you can always put more down if you want to. If you have a score that's below 580, you'll need to put at least 10% down to qualify for an FHA loan. Yes, FHA interest rates vary by lender. Though the Federal Housing Administration insures FHA mortgages, it doesn't set the rates offered by lenders. To get an FHA loan, you'll need to apply for a mortgage with a lender that offers these mortgages. Yes, you can refinance an FHA loan. If you're refinancing into another FHA loan, you may even be able to get a streamline refinance, which doesn't require an appraisal and may not require a credit check. Many borrowers refinance their FHA loans to conventional loans to remove mortgage insurance once they reach 20% equity. You can only use an FHA loan to finance the purchase of a property you intend to live in as your primary residence. However, you may be able to buy a property with up to four units as long as you live in one of the units. Then, the other units can be rented out.",https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/fha-interest-rates
Best HELOC Lenders,"HELOC rates are a little higher than currentmortgage rates, but they could still allow a homeowner to save money on borrowing for construction costs or consolidating debt when compared topersonal loan ratesorcredit card rates. HELOC rates are tied to an index, meaning they can fluctuate over time depending on what's going on in the broader economy. For example, HELOC rates are typically tied to theprime rate, which is based on the federal funds rate set bythe Federal Reserve. The Fed sets this rate based on its policy goals. When inflation is high, the Fed raises rates to slow economic growth. If the economy is struggling, central bankers may lower rates to help avoid a recession. This in turn impacts the rates consumers pay on their loans, including HELOCs. Lenders add a margin to their HELOC rates as well. So a lender could set its rates based on the prime rate plus 0.50 percentage points, for example. The exact rate you'll pay also depends on your own financial situation. Those with better credit scores, for example, tend to get better rates. HELOCs usually come with variable interest rates. This means the rate you pay could change periodically, causing your monthly payment to go up or down. Depending on your lender, your rate could adjust every month. Some lenders offer fixed-rate HELOCs, but these may come with higher rates and fees. Fixed-rate HELOCs work similarly to regular HELOCs; in fact, they're sort of a hybrid between a variable-rate loan and a fixed-rate loan. These HELOCs give you the option to lock some or all of your balance in at a fixed rate. This can be beneficial if interest rates start rising. For example, Bank of America, one of our top HELOC lender picks, offers a fixed-rate option on its HELOC. With Bank of America, HELOC borrowers can have up to three fixed-rate balances at a time. The best HELOC lenders offer loans with beneficial features like no fees, lower minimum credit score requirements, large loan amounts, and high maximum CLTVs. They also rank high in customer satisfaction. These are the best HELOC lenders according to Business Insider editors in 2024. Offers a 0.10% discount for each $10,000 withdrawal you make 6.490%  intro variable APR for 6 months then 9.590% Variable (vary by location) Bank of America is an overall solid option for borrowers, with a max CLTV on the more affordable end, no fees, and the ability to explore rates by state on its website. Bank of America is an overall solid option for borrowers, with a max CLTV on the more affordable end, no fees, and the ability to explore rates by state on its website. CurrentBank of Americacustomers may be able to get a small rate discount if they set up auto payments from their checking or savings account, or if they're aPreferred Rewardsmember. You may also be able to receive a 0.10% discount for each $10,000 withdrawal you make. Bank of America offers the option to convert some or all of your balance to a fixed rate. HELOCs almost always come with variable rates, though some lenders offer this option to convert some of your balance to a fixed rate after you've started making withdrawals. What to look out for:Bank of America doesn't disclose the minimum credit score you'll need to get a HELOC, but HELOC lenders typically look for scores in the high 600s. Offers HELOCs to borrowers with credit scores as low as 620, New American Funding is a good choice if you have little equity or a lower credit score. New American Funding is a good choice if your credit score is on the low end for a HELOC. Typically, lenders want borrowers to have higher credit scores, sometimes above 700. But New American Funding offers HELOCs to borrowers with credit scores as low as 620, which makes it a good option if you can't get approved for a HELOC elsewhere. What to look out for:New American Funding doesn't disclose its rates online, so it's difficult to compare its overall affordability to other lenders. Borrow up to 95% of your home's value, minus what you currently owe on your first mortgage Navy Federal Credit Union charges no lender fees, no annual fee, and no inactivity fee, making it an affordable option for borrowers. Navy Federal Credit Union charges no lender fees, no annual fee, and no inactivity fee, making it an affordable option for borrowers. With a HELOC from Navy Federal Credit Union, you can borrow up to 95% of your home's value, minus what you currently owe on your first mortgage. This is particularly beneficial forVA loanborrowers who put 0% down at closing, since they may not have a ton of equity built up in their home yet. What to look out for:To get a HELOC with this lender, you must be a member of Navy Federal. You need to be a member of the military, a veteran, a family member of someone who has served, or a Department of Defense civilian to become a member. The BBB gives Navy Federal anNR (No Rating)because it's responding to complaints that were previously closed. No lender closing fees if you keep your HELOC account open for at least three years 7.74% to 21.00% Variable (vary by location) Flagstar Bank is a good choice if you want to take out a lot of equity. But its maximum APR is on the high end, and it charges an annual fee. Flagstar Bank is a good choice if you want to take out a lot of equity. Flagstar Bank offers HELOC loan amounts up to $1 million, making it a strong choice if you have a lot of equity and are funding a high-cost project. You may also be able to get a customer discount if you have a Flagstar checking or savings account. And you won't pay lender closing fees if you keep your HELOC account open for at least three years. What to look out for:Flagstar isn't as affordable as some of the other lenders on this list. It charges a $75 annual fee (this is waived your first year) and APRs can go up to 21%. May be able to get a discount by setting up auto payments from your Citizens checking account Citizens Bank offers both a traditional HELOC and its GoalBuilder HELOC. Its GoalBuilder HELOC offers loan amounts as low as $5,000, making it a solid option for borrowers who only need a small line of credit. Citizens Bank offers both a traditional HELOC and its GoalBuilder HELOC. Its GoalBuilder HELOC offers loan amounts as low as $5,000, making it a solid option for borrowers who only need a small line of credit. Citizens Bank's advertised rates are relatively low, and you may be able to get a discount by setting up auto payments from your Citizens checking account. This lender doesn't charge an application or closing fee, though you will pay a $50 annual fee (this is waived your first year). What to look out for:Availability is limited compared to other lenders on this list, as you can't get a Citizens HELOC in most states. An interest-only HELOC has an annual fee of $50 that's waived the first year Alliant Credit Union is an affordable choice for borrowers looking to keep their out-of-pocket costs to a minimum. It charges no lender fees at closing (for loans up to $250,000) and no annual fee on its standard HELOC. Alliant Credit Union is an affordable choice for borrowers looking to keep their out-of-pocket costs to a minimum. It charges no lender fees at closing (for loans up to $250,000). Alliant's HELOC comes with an interest-only draw period that lasts 10 years, followed by a repayment period of up to 20 years. What to look out for:If you close your Alliant HELOC within three years of getting it, you may be charged a $200 cancellation fee. Interest-only borrowers may pay slightly higher rates than standard borrowers. HELOCs from this lender are only available in 25 states and Washington, D.C. We've rounded up the HELOC lenders we think are best, but that doesn't necessarily mean every lender on this list is going to be a good fit for you. Here are some things you should think about as you shop for a HELOC. Ahome equity line of credit(HELOC) is a type of second mortgage that homeowners can use to get cash to fund home improvement projects, debt consolidation, or other financial goals. It works not unlike a credit card, but the money you're borrowing comes from your home's equity. Home equity is the difference between what your house is worth and the total value of the loans you have on the property. It's the portion of your home's value that you own outright, without any debt attached. For example, when you make a down payment of 20% on a home purchase, you start out with 20% equity in the home. HELOCs are split up into two periods: the draw period and the repayment period. During the draw period, your HELOC will work similarly to a credit card. You can borrow against your line of credit, and you'll only be charged interest on what you borrow. During this time, you'll need to make payments on the interest you accrue. This period usually lasts 10 years. Then comes the repayment period, which is typically spread out over 20 years. You'll make both principal and interest payments during this time, and you won't be able to borrow from the HELOC anymore. HELOC lenders typically like to see a combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) between 80% and 90%, but it varies. Aloan-to-value ratio (LTV)is the ratio of how much you owe on your mortgage versus what your house is worth. A CLTV includes all of the loans you have on your property, including first and second mortgages. Your CLTV is the inverse of your equity. If your house is worth $500,000 and you owe a total of $200,000 on your first mortgage and your HELOC, your CLTV is 40%, and you have 60% equity in your home. The main requirement to be eligible for a HELOC is that you'll need to have a certain amount of equity. This varies by lender, but you may need to keep at least 10% or 20% equity in your home (or a max CLTV of 80% or 90%, like we mentioned above) Navy Federal Credit Union, one of our favorite HELOC lenders, lets you borrow up to 95% of your home's value. This means that you'd only need to keep 5% equity in your home. The rest you can access with the HELOC. You'll also need to meet your lender's credit requirements. In general, you won't be able to qualify for a HELOC with acredit scorebelow 620, and some lenders have higher minimum requirements. Your DTI can't be too high. Exact requirements vary by lender, but it's typically below 50%. If your current score isn't great, working toimprove your credit scorecan help you snag a lower rate on your HELOC. Be sure to make on-time payments on any debt you owe and keep your utilization low. Paying down credit card debt or asking for a credit line increase on your credit cards can help lower your utilization and boost your credit score. Get rate quotes from multiple HELOC lenders and compare offers to make sure you're getting the best rate available to you. Experts generally recommend talking to at least three different lenders to compare rates. Because HELOC rates are variable, you should talk to your lender about how much your rate could go up, and if it has a cap on its HELOC rates. Make sure you can afford your monthly HELOC payment even if your rate increases significantly over time. HELOCs are flexible, letting you borrow what you need as you need it. Home equity loans require you to receive the full balance in one lump sum, meaning you'll pay interest on that full loan amount. But if you don't borrow the maximum amount from your HELOC, you'll only pay interest on your outstanding balance. HELOCs often have lower rates compared to alternatives like credit cards and personal loans. And if you have a lot of equity, you may be able to borrow more than you could with other loan types. The big risk with a HELOC is that your payment could increase if rates start going up. It's also risky to tie debt to your property. If you default on your HELOC, the lender canforecloseon your home. Some lenders may also have minimum withdrawal requirements, meaning you'll need to take out at least that amount every time you want to borrow from your HELOC. This could result in you paying interest on more money than you actually need. Aim to get quotes from a few different lenders to be sure you get the best deal. Pay attention to both rates as well as any fees a lender charges. The HELOC application process is similar to applying for other types of loans. The lender will do a check of your credit and ask fordocumentationshowing your income. They'll also likely need to order ahome appraisalto confirm your property's current value. Your lender will help guide you through this process. If you're approved, you'll pay your closing costs and close on the loan. Ahome equity loanis another type of second mortgage that utilizes your home's equity. But home equity loans are disbursed in one lump sum, so you'll immediately receive the full amount you're borrowing. You'll also begin principal and interest repayments right away. Home equity loans have fixed rates, so your monthly payment will remain the same throughout the life of the loan. Instead of getting a second mortgage like a home equity loan or HELOC, you could replace your first mortgage by refinancing. Acash-out refinancelets you tap into your home's equity while replacing your current mortgage with a new loan that has entirely new terms. This can be beneficial if you're able to get a lower rate on the new mortgage than what you're currently paying. But if today's mortgage rates are higher than your current rate, a cash-out refinance probably doesn't make sense. These loans also come withclosing costs, which can be between 3% and 6% of the loan amount. Personal loans are a type ofunsecured debt, meaning they aren't tied to any collateral. Because of this, they come with higher rates compared to HELOCs and home equity loans. They also typically have shorter terms, which means the monthly payments on these loans are higher. The benefit of personal loans is the process is typically faster than the HELOC application process, so you can get your funds sooner. You also won't have to worry about losing your home if you default on the loan. Some lenders offer fixed-rate HELOCs, but be sure to understand the rates and fees that come with this option. Current HELOC rates fluctuate from day to day and vary by lender, but they're generally a bit higher than the current prime rate. A HELOC might be a good idea for you if you have a lot of equity in your home and want to fund a home improvement project or consolidate higher-interest debt. Make sure your credit is in great shape before applying for a HELOC, and be sure to get quotes from at least three different lenders to be sure you're getting the lowest rate possible.",https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/current-heloc-rates

Coverage needs:Your needs will vary depending on your individual situation. You'll want to think about how often and how well you drive (be honest with yourself). You'll also want to think about the value of your car. Generally, it's a good idea to go beyond state minimums and opt forfull coverage, which can be a mix of liability, comprehensive, and collision car insurance to ensure you've covered your bases in a wide range of scenarios. Experts recommend going beyond the minimum liability coverage limits because the medical and property damage costs can go far beyond state minimums in a severe accident. Depending on the state, this could leave you vulnerable to more significant financial losses. Budget:Your budget will also play a large part in determining the right provider and policy. It may be beneficial to determine how much you can spend before you go about obtaining quotes from various providers. Discounts:Going hand-in-hand with your budget, you'll want to consider the discounts that your provider of choice offers and what you'll qualify for. Perhaps you already have homeowners or renters insurance with a company, and you can secure a discount on your existing policies and your auto insurance if you bundle. Customer service:You can assess how a car insurance company treats its customers by looking at reviews on third party sites like the Better Business Bureau or Trustpilot. You can also look at JD Power auto insurance customer satisfaction ratings in the region you live/drive in. You should consider how you want to interact with your auto insurance company, be it online, over the phone with a live agent, or through a mobile app. To determine the best auto insurance companies, we compare affordability, customer satisfaction, coverage options, optional coverage, benefits for policyholders, financial strength, and accessibility. No single factor accounts for everything consumers need; not all auto insurance companies are created the same. We compared quotes, customer reviews, financial stability, and the company's history. With all these factors combined, we rate numerous competitors to see which companies rise to the top. Auto insurance, in particular, is primarily run on a state and regional basis. In short, most auto insurance providers are only licensed in some states. As such, the best car insurance companies for a driver in New York may differ from the best option for similar drivers in California. We use numerous sources to get an objective view of each provider. Our reviews are not sponsored by the companies being reviewed. Each review reflects our opinion based solely on the facts gathered. Reviews may be updated as facts change (for example, JD Power rankings are updated when new reports are released). However, requests from insurers that conflict with public-facing websites are not factored into our reviews. Read more abouthow Business Insider rates auto insurance. State Farm is highly ranked in many JD Power surveys and maintains the highest market share of any auto insurance company in the United States. The company is known for exclusive insurance quoted only by State Farm agents. However, it is outperformed in some areas by smaller regional carriers.

Best Homeowners Insurance,"A good home insurance company can reduce a family disaster to a small bump in the road.

Highly rated by JD Power and available in 48 states and Washington, DC. Amica homeowners insurance ranks high with JD Power, operating in 48 states and Washington, DC.

It offers competitive rates and coverage. State Farm offers six discounts to help you save on your homeowners insurance policy. State Farm Insurance is sold exclusively by captive agents, limiting options to compare rates. However, State Farm agents are extensively trained to quote State Farm policies with all applicable discounts, especially if you choose to bundle your insurance coverage. State Farm offers coverage for most homes. GEICO homeowners insurance is one of many products the online giant offers. But, unlike its auto insurance, it encourages customers to work with its call center agents to find the right fit, buy all necessary coverage, etc. Offers many coverage riders to enhance your homeowners coverage and many discounts. Allstate offers many of the most important personal insurance products, including homeowners insurance. It leads the market in discounts, but its base rates may not be as competitive as State Farm and other big competitors. Whatever the situation, quality home insurance coverage could be the difference between full recovery and financial ruin after a home-based incident. A strong home insurance company will assess the damage and pay your claim quickly. Policies are clear, and many insurance companies will deploy agents to hold your hand and help you every step of the way. Amica homeowners insurance tops the charts with industry resources like J.D.

But like its other products,USAA USAA Homeowners Insurancemaintains a tight grip on the homeowners insurance market for that select population. Its plans offer both the cheapest home insurance and the best coverage available to US military members. When combined with car insurance, bank accounts, and other products, insured parties may qualify for even lower prices. Read ourUSAA homeowners insurance review. State Farm homeowners insurance remains one of the most recognizable names in insurance, particularly in homeowners andaffordable car insurance. The company works exclusively with captive agents (i.e., agents can only quote and sell State Farm or State Farm partner products). So if you don't like your quote, want to compare home insurance quotes, or don't qualify for coverage, you'll have to talk to at least one more insurance agent. But its agents can get you the most competitive quotes with all applicable discounts for State Farm products. State Farm agents can quote and bind policies for most single-family residences, condos, etc. However, you may run into trouble for multi-units with more than four legal units or in high-risk (but insurable) areas such as higher lava zones or areas affected by wildfires. Read ourState Farm homeowners insurance review. GEICO home insurance is often bundled with GEICO auto insurance. For homeowners working with a mortgage lender, GEICO has a separate department to assist in binding and finalizing the details of your home insurance. Particularly for small homes and condo insurance, GEICO offers cutthroat pricing. Compared to many other discount home insurance companies, GEICO also offers friendly service, easy underwriting approval, and quick claims processing. In the event of a claim, the payout may not be what you'd expect from companies like State Farm, Allstate, or Amica Mutual. Depending on where you live, you may also have to call its toll-free line to get home insurance quotes. Read ourGEICO homeowners insurance review. Allstate homeowners insurance is known for the character ""Mayhem."" Mayhem, played by actor Dean Winters, plays out real claims scenarios Allstate has paid in entertaining commercials. Allstate offers a range of home insurance products including plans for investors to cover the structure and liability associated with having tenants. Renters should supplement withrenters coverage, but Allstate plans are highly customizable. Like State Farm, Allstate is only quoted through the company's captive agents, and they do not insure structures with more than four units. Read ourAllstate homeowners insurance review. While uncommon, some homes are uninsurable. This would include homes in certain fire zones and lava zones. Beachfront properties (depending on the distance to the ocean) can be insured, but only with higher premiums for lower coverage limits. Not all insurers offer coverage for high-risk areas. The exact rules vary between policies. This is why it's critical to work with an insurance agent you trust and review your policy documents. An all perils home insurance policy will cover damage caused by anything that's not specifically excluded in the policy documents. With decades of claims and underwriting experience, insurers list exclusions from lava and hurricanes to riots, war, nuclear hazards, and government action. So read carefully before assuming specific incidents will be covered under your home insurance. If you choose a named-perils policy, you may get the cheapest home insurance rates available to you. As you might expect, insurers only cover damage associated with perils listed in the policy documents. So the risk of unpaid claims is higher. In short, if your named perils policy covers damage from fires, lightning, and explosions, you would not be covered if a car crashed into your home unless it caused an explosion. Similarly, you decide what property coverage you want up front. Dwelling coverage (the cost to repair or replace your home if destroyed) is a constant, particularly if you have a mortgage. Many other coverages are optional. Homeowners who want thecheapest home insurance rateswhen shopping for homeowners insurance might skip personal property coverage. Investors renting properties out might also skip personal property coverage while increasing liability coverage. If a covered peril damages your home, though, you would then be responsible to replace furniture, clothing, electronics, and any other personal property. The exact breakdown of coverage varies between home insurance companies. No matter where you buy, there are two exclusions with no exceptions. Mortgage lendersrequire borrowers to buy a homeowners policy covering the cost to rebuild your home. This estimate is based on the appraisal or your insurance agent's estimated replacement cost matrix. Some homeowners are also required to pay for regional coverage such as flood, hurricane, or earthquake. Unless you specify otherwise, the lender will then collect a small amount each month to pay your premium for you once a year. Keep in mind, all insurance notices will be sent to you automatically. So if prices go up or you want to switch for any reason, you have control over your homeowners insurance. Important note:Your insurance company will still send you notices when payments are due, if payment is missed, etc. DO NOT ignore these as your mortgage company can buy its own (much more expensive) policy if yours lapses. The cheapest home insurance is not always the most affordable. Homeowners insurance quotes give buyers a preview of what they may pay each year. But this doesn't account for the cost of claims or how much you could pay out of pocket if your claims are denied or your insurer drags out the process. When shopping for home insurance, we balance cost with performance and coverage. The Better Business Bureau accepts a company's customer complaints and reviews advertising and transparency about business practices. Once a complaint is submitted, companies can respond and resolve the issues. The BBB ranking does not guarantee great rates or that you'll love the company. That's why we also looked at average rates, reviews from sites like TrustPilot, and sample plans to compare coverage options. However, a company with a high BBB rating is more likely to stay above board and address consumer issues. USAA's limited availability makes it impractical for organizations like JD Power or the BBB to rank it alongside companies that sell to a more diverse range of users. However, many of our top home insurance picks maintain the BBB's highest ranking. When combined with strong JD Power, AM Best rankings, reviews from real homeowners, and advice from our expert panel, we feel confident saying our top picks are also trustworthy home insurance companies for the average consumer. Yes, most people have homeowners insurance. If you have a mortgage, your lender will require home insurance. In most cases, your homeowners insurance invoices will be sent to your lender, and it will add costs to your monthly payments. Among homeowners who own their home outright, most still have insurance to protect against the unexpected. An umbrella policy offers a boost in coverage for multiple policies with one premium. If you're bundling your homeowners and auto insurance policies with one company, raising your liability limits on each policy could be costly. Whether you're in an auto accident or your dog bites the mailman, the ensuing claim can be costly, especially if you don't have sufficient liability coverage. A home insurance policy for a condo could be as little as $200 annually depending on coverage. A homeowners policy for a single-family detached structure on a beachfront could be $5,000 or more annually. With so many factors to consider, a licensed insurance agent is the best resource for customized plans to meet individual needs. At a minimum, homeowners need replacement coverage for the structure. In short, your insurance company runs a cost assessment to estimate the construction cost for replacing your home if it were completely destroyed. More importantly, check your coverage exclusions, add-ons like water backup coverage, and personal property coverage limits. Even if you have limited personal belongings, furnishing a house could quickly reach $100,000 or more. We spoke to a variety of experts to inform our picks for this best home insurance guide, and to give readers additional advice for finding the right policy. You can read what they had to say later in this guide, under the Experts' Advice section. We worked with a realtor, homeowners insurance agent, and mortgage loan originator to discuss what buyers should consider when buying home insurance. You can find their full commentary below. Lina Roby, Former Insurance Editor with Personal Finance Insider Homeowners should take into account both coverage and price. Critical riders like water backup coverage cost you as little as a few dollars per renewal period while saving you thousands in the event of a claim. When calculating your monthly mortgage costs, the right homeowners insurance ensures your home also fits your budget. Stephanie Andrews, Realtor with Keller WilliamsHawaii Dream Homes Homeowners should have complete coverage without too many stipulations or exceptions. Jeremy Yang, Homeowners Insurance Agent withIFG Insurance LLC Details of the policy are important. Ex:Replacement Cost vs Actual Cash Value coverage/endorsement like water backup coverage. Chelsie Sorino, Mortgage Loan Originator with CF Home Loans LLC I believe is most important to look for when buying homeowners insurance is making sure that your coverage is truly comprehensive. A named peril policy provides coverage ONLY for the select types of damages listed in the specific policy. On the other hand, a comprehensive peril policy makes getting insurance to cover any incident much easier. Lina Roby, Former Insurance Editor with Personal Finance Insider Consider how much you can afford to spend in the event of a claim? If you cannot afford to spend $1,000 out of pocket to deal with a major flood, for example, a $1,000 deductible may lower your monthly premium, but it's too high. Stephanie Andrews, Realtor with Keller Williams Hawaii Dream Homes Your deductible should match your income and available cash on hand. Having a larger deductible will save you money, but if you can't afford to pay a large deductible when you need the insurance, then the extra savings don't matter. Jeremy Yang, Homeowners Insurance Agent with IFG Insurance LLC Your deductible should be based on claim history & affordability. If you have no claims history and are not likely to file claim, you can raise your deductible. But understand that the deductible will be the out-of-pocket amount if any claim are filed. Chelsie Sorino, Mortgage Loan Originator with CF Home Loans LLC Low deductible plans require higher monthly premiums but lower out of pocket expenses. High deductible plans provide lower monthly premiums but higher expenses in the event of an insurance claim. You should choose a deductible that balances out your monthly and out-of-pocket costs in the event of a claim. Lina Roby, Former Insurance Editor with Personal Finance Insider Many homeowners underestimate the importance of riders. All they see is extra costs. The bulk of your monthly premiums is spent on dwelling coverage, personal property, and other key parts of homeowners coverage. The devil is in the details, especially when it comes to homeowners insurance riders. Stephanie Andrews, Realtor with Keller Williams Hawaii Dream Homes Not getting enough coverage for a complete rebuild, not checking for specific coverage like flood or hurricane, and not looking at the conditions of the insurance. Jeremy Yang, Homeowners Insurance Agent with IFG Insurance LLC Most buyers will choose the cheapest insurance, which might leads to homeowners being underinsured. Getting insurance with not enough coverage is like driving a car with a drawing of a seatbelt on your shirt. Chelsie Sorino, Mortgage Loan Originator with CF Home Loans LLC Equipment breakdown coverage is something that I see buyers missing when buying homeowners insurance. This is an easy & affordable rider. Common examples of covered equipment being air conditioning systems, furnaces, heat pumps, heaters, and kitchen & laundry appliances. Sites like J.D Power, user review sites, and other sources play a role in our reviews, as do policy documents. While we cannot look at every policyholder's documents, most home insurance companies have specific coverage limits and benefits applicable to all standard policies. To come up with our list of the best home insurance companies, we also considered common exclusions and the impact on the average homeowner compared to average premiums. We take into account customer experience and the claims experience. While homeowners hope to never experience a partial or full loss of their home, most do. Finally, we factor in financial stability. Regardless of size, insurance companies walk a tight line between premiums coming in and claims payments going out. We look for insurers likely to be around for the foreseeable future.

Read ourLadder life insurance review. While there are many differenttypes of life insurance policies, broadly speaking, there are two types of life insurance: temporary and permanent. Let's go over each in detail. Temporary life insurance is often called term life insurance. This type of policy covers you for a set amount of time before expiring, usually between 10-30 years. If you pass away after your policy expires, your family won't receive any benefits. Additionally, your policy won't accrue cash value like a permanent policy. That said, some term life insurance policies offer aconversion from term to whole life insurance,so you can extend your coverage. Because its benefits aren't guaranteed, term life policies are generally cheaper than permanent life insurance. That said, the vast majority of term life insurance policies never pay out. Permanent life insurance is an umbrella term for a variety of life insurance policies that will insure you indefinitely and guarantee a payout as long as you maintain your policy. Policy types that fall under permanent life insurance includes: These policies vary widely in purpose and intended buyers, but all guarantee death benefits to your loved ones. Some permanent life insurance policies, like whole, universal, and variable have acash value component, which you can use as a savings tool or to leave your heirs a larger death benefit. Unlike homeowners or auto insurance, which is required by most states, life insurance is a voluntary purchase. As a result, it's not as easy to purchase life insurance online. As a result, finding the best life insurance for your needs starts with finding a trusted insurance agent. Agents can help buyers figure out what they need and when they need it. However, there are a few things you can consider before approaching an agent: Some companies will sell you a policy for your child as soon as they're born. While this may seem morbid, early sign-up means lower rates for a policy your child could enjoy in the future. Regardless, early sign-up equates to more policy for lower premiums and a higher likelihood of acceptance. At 20, you may be healthier and be able to pay into the policy for a longer period compared to when you're 50 with more age-related conditions. As a general rule, never agree to more than you can afford. For the average life insurance agent, their job is to sell you a large policy with a large commission. Consider not only how much you make now, but how likely your current income is to continue. If you work on a project basis and your project is scheduled to end in 12 months, you may want to reconsider apolicy premiumoutside your monthly savings. How much are you prepared to buy? Some people only want a small policy to cover funerals and other end-of-life expenses. Others build a life policy into their retirement plan. Whatever direction you're going, involving a financial planner could help you make the right decisions. Depending on the carrier, customers can also compare set limits with index universal life policies, which set no limit. These policies never expire, and the value builds over the entirety of your life. Life happens unexpectedly. You could be healthy one day and in the hospital the next. Many life policies offer living benefits. These allow you to draw a limited amount out of your policy to cover medical and other bills you cannot pay while sick. Much like a 401(k), many life insurance policies have penalties for early withdrawal. No matter what policy you want, this question is critical to an informed decision. It's a question of how early you can withdraw and how much you'll lose from the total to have the money in 10 years instead of 30 or after death. Some policies require insured parties to pay premiums for at least one year before any significant payout would be available. Suicide exclusions are common. Even with no medical exam policies, the company may still do a check for known conditions. An insurance company has to mitigate its risk. Once you've been denied a life insurance policy, a mark goes on your record. No matter the reasons, other insurance companies may deny you coverage based on the first denial. So consider your whole situation and choose your policy carefully before you submit any applications. Some policies have greater flexibility if you lose your job or otherwise can't make payments. Others will lapse if you miss even one payment. The best life insurance for you will also depend on how you want to pay for it. Universal policies have flexible premiums and adjustable death benefits, which may be appealing if you're worried about periods of financial hardship. Even withinwhole life or term lifeinsurance policies, customers have the option to choose guaranteed fixed or variable rates. Some have guaranteed payouts, but you'll need to ask your agent for details. Additionally, you may not want to pay for life insurance throughout the duration of the policy's lifetime. In that case, you'll want to look for a limited payment life insurance policy, which sets a predetermined payment period instead of the policy's lifetime. What is your intended use? Why are you shopping for a life insurance policy in the first place, and what are your goals? Many successful financial planners also have a background in life insurance. So while they may not be able to find you a specific life insurance policy, financial planners can help you set out a blueprint for your purchase. In life insurance, it's easy to get ""sold a bill of goods."" Many life insurance agents pass a state test to be thrown into the deep end. Agents sell the company product, but not all know the products. In this vein, we look at the products each company offers. We also look at agent training. A good life insurance agent may not volunteer all facts upfront. But a company's agents should answer questions about its products accurately and in a way the average consumer can digest. Agents should be able to inform you about the long-term benefits and limitations. This will help customers find the right policy for their long-term plan. We consider affordability, policy sizes available, and performance for a comprehensive assessment. If you can, we recommend also working with a financial advisor to make a plan for your future with life insurance. Read more abouthow Business Insider rates life insurance. To inform our choices for the best life insurance companies, we spoke with the following experts: Paul LaPiana, Head of Product at MassMutual ""There are different approaches to determining how much life insurance you need. One is the 'human life' approach, which estimates the current value of your future earning potential. Another is securing specific coverage to pay off debts such as a mortgage or provide for the education of children. A comprehensive protection plan should provide the right amount of coverage over the course of your working life and into retirement."" Barbara A. Pietrangelo, Chair of Life Happens ""There is no one-size-fits-all life insurance policy because everyone is different. One way to get a rough estimate is to multiply your income by 10 to 15; another is adding $100,00 to that amount, should you have a child and anticipate college education expenses. Your best bet is to talk to a financial professional or use the Life Insurance Needs Calculator on LifeHappens.org to analyze what's right for you."" Wykeeta Peel, Corporate Vice President & Market Manager African American Market Unit at New York Life ""As you consider what policy best meets your needs, it can help to answer four key questions: First, how much death benefit do you need? Second, how long will you need that coverage? Third, what is your budget (or how much monthly premium can you afford to pay?), and finally, what is your investment risk tolerance? To determine how much death benefit makes sense, it's helpful to think beyond using life insurance to cover funeral expenses and consider whether anyone is relying on the policy owner's income to maintain a lifestyle, pay rent or a mortgage, or fund a child's education and for how long. There are various rules of thumb regarding the right amount of Life insurance coverage. Some tips can be found online, but they only provide an estimate and don't necessarily factor in an individual's specific needs. In my opinion, human guidance, powered by technology, is required. Basically, it comes down to how much money your loved ones would need to remain on firm financial ground if your earnings were no longer in the picture and that is different for everyone."" Paul LaPiana, Head of Product at MassMutual ""Increased accessibility through digital and other channels as well as through underwriting enhancements. Increased tailoring of products and features. And an increased emphasis on health and wellness programs."" Barbara A. Pietrangelo, Chair of Life Happens ""Having enough qualified insurance professionals to walk potential buyers through the multiple benefits of life insurance will be pivotal to the growth of the industry. Education is a key factor here, as professional agents also need to be able to explain life insurance and its benefits in an easy, digestible way, especially when there are so many misconceptions about life insurance."" Wykeeta Peel, Corporate Vice President & Market Manager African American Market Unit at New York Life ""The need for life insurance is greater than ever. In fact, a recentNew York Life Wealth Watch surveyfound that 37% of adults have been thinking about life insurance more often these days – and half of adults report that financial products that provide protection (50%) and reliability (50%) are more important now compared to last year. This may be especially true for middle-market and Cultural Market families. Our organizational structure of having Cultural Market agents embedded in the communities where we live and work allows us to understand the needs of diverse communities and develop solutions that resonate with them."" Paul LaPiana, Head of Product at MassMutual ""It is difficult to say with any certainty how healthy you will be years from now. That's why securing life insurance, and insuring your insurability, today, when you are the youngest you'll ever be again, and perhaps your healthiest is a wise decision."" Barbara A. Pietrangelo, Chair of Life Happens ""Do you love someone? If the answer is yes, then life insurance is certainly something you should consider. Many buy gifts and experiences to express their love, but haven't considered that life insurance is just another way to say I love you. Nothing says support like ensuring your family's financial security and peace of mind."" Wykeeta Peel, Corporate Vice President & Market Manager African American Market Unit at New York Life ""If you have someone depending on your income, you should consider purchasing life insurance. A death benefit from a life insurance policy can replace income from the loss of a breadwinner, ensure a family can stay in their home, fund educational or retirement expenses, address debt and so much more. A life insurance policy can also help you grow your family's wealth over time. Once the risk of an unexpected loss has been managed, you can begin to think more broadly about your family's financial future. Life insurance can enable your mindset to shift from death to growth."" Paul LaPiana, Head of Product at MassMutual ""With life insurance, you are securing a future commitment that may be decades away. Research the company behind the policy to ensure it has high financial strength ratings, longevity, and an excellent track record of paying claims."" Barbara A. Pietrangelo, Chair of Life Happens ""When looking for an insurance agent or company, be sure to do your research. When comparing companies, be sure to remember that the policy features that fit you and your loved ones best is the most important factor. Don't automatically assume you should buy from the higher-rated company. If the policy from the other company has more of what you're looking for, it might be the better choice.

In addition to this critical work, the ASPCA lends its name to affordable pet health insurance plans with great benefits. At this time, the ASPCA does not sell or underwrite insurance, but it does receive royalties to add its name to this pet insurance plan. Coverage is available for dogs, cats, and horses. Standard plans with the ASPCA include coverage for things like congenital conditions, alternative therapies, and behavioral issues.

Owners with multiple eligible pets also get a 10% discount monthly.

It provides illness and accident coverage for cats and dogs, including plans without limits and a lifetime, per-condition deductible, saving you money if your pet has recurring health issues. However, if your pet contracts a variety of illnesses, your better off with one of the other companies on this list. The most crucial distinction for Trupanion is its low out-of-pocket costs. Eligible customers can choose a $0 deductible with 90% reimbursement. So in a pet emergency, you only pay 10% of eligible vet bills, though a $0 deductible policy will have high monthly premiums. Trupanion also has the unique ability to pay eligible vets directly, so you don't have to go through claims every time you take your pet to the vet. Pets over 14 years old are ineligible for coverage, and illness coverage has a 30-day waiting period. But Trupanion also offers valuable add-ons that'll cover boarding fees if a pet owner is hospitalized, behavioral and rehabilitative therapy, and coverage for unintentional property damage caused by a pet. Read ourTrupanion pet insurance review. Figo is unique in that it offers a 100% reimbursement option.

Nationwide's Whole Pet plan covers illnesses, accidents, and some hereditary and congenital conditions, but does not cover wellness treatments. You'll be able to cover preventive care costs with its Major Medical with Wellness plan, but this lacks hereditary and congenital condition coverage. It's worth noting that Nationwide has recently announced non-renewals for approximately 100,000 policies from now until the summer of 2025 as a result of rising vet costs and inflation. This may signal some future financial uncertainty, so dog and cat owners may want to look elsewhere for long-term coverage. However, if you have an exotic pet, Nationwide is one of your only options.

You'll also need to sign up your pet before their second birthday to qualify for the AKC's optional coverage for hereditary or congenital conditions. American Kennel Club is unique because it covers both curable and incurablepreexisting conditionsafter a 12-month waiting period.

Unlike many other pet insurance providers, Pumpkin offers coverage for preventable diseases (excluding pre-existing conditions) like Lyme or parvovirus.

In contrast, other providers may require waiting periods of up to 60 days. The waiting period is for current and future treatment.

You can check its website or run a quote to find out if Lemonade pet insurance is available for your pets. Read ourLemonade pet insurance review. When looking for pet insurance plans, comparing different providers is essential to find the best coverage and price. Some factors to consider include the cost of premiums, the amount of coverage offered, the waiting period for coverage of pre-existing conditions, and the reimbursement percentage for veterinary care. It's also important to read the fine print to understand what is and isn't covered. For example, many pet insurance policies don't cover routine vet care such as vaccinations and annual checkups. It should also be noted that pet insurance companies don't necessarily define ""pre-existing conditions"" the same way every time. For example, some companies provide coverage for ""curable"" conditions. If your pet needs expensive surgery or treatment, you may only receive a fraction of the cost back from the insurance company. Pet insurance can be a great way to protect yourself from costly vet bills in an emergency. So, do your homework and shop around to find the best policy for your pet. Pet insurance plans may differ when it comes to specifics, but in general you'll want to look for a policy that provides as much coverage as possible, with few exceptions or exclusions. Comprehensive pet insurance will cover both accidents and illness, and some even include preventive care like wellness checkups. In general, you should purchase the policy that offers the most comprehensive coverage — especially if you foresee any issues arising with your pet. Some benefits are less common than others. It's worth checking to see if a company includes prescription food coverage, end-of-live benefits, and congenital/hereditary condition coverage. You should also see how your policy handles curable pre-existing conditions. A comprehensive pet insurance policy will cost more than an accident-only plan, but it should still be relatively affordable, and it could make a big difference if your pet needs care down the line. Most pet insurance plans let you customize coverage (to include or exclude things like wellness visits) and customize your deductible. You can choose to pay a higher deductible, which will lower your monthly pet insurance payment, or you can pick a lower deductible, which will mean a higher monthly premium. The best option for you really depends on your financial situation and whether you expect large vet bills anytime soon. When purchasing a plan, you should also note any per-incident or lifetime limits on your policy. If you hit a lifetime limit on your policy, you'll have to switch insurance providers. In doing so, you'll lose coverage for the conditions your pet developed while under previous coverage. Cost is one of the primary considerations when choosing a policy for your pet. The best pet insurance policy will save you more money than you spent on premiums. You'll want to find policies that cover the most costs while charging the least. This could mean finding the most comprehensive policy or reducing your coverage for a smaller monthly premium. For example, accident-only coverage is often far cheaper than comprehensive coverage. You can find our guide on thebest cheap pet insurancehere. On the other hand, you may also opt for a policy that has preventative care coverage. This can cost more than a standard policy, but can prevent your pet from getting sick, saving you money in the long run. Unfortunately, the cost of pet insurance is largely out of your control, dependent on your pet's breed and age. That said, there are ways that you can still save without influencing the underwriting process. For one, you can opt for multi-pet insurance as many of thebest multi-pet insurancecompanies offer discounts of up to 10%. Additionally, some of the larger companies that offer multiple types of insurance may allow you to bundle your pet insurance with other types of insurance, like auto or home. When it comes to pet insurance, there are a lot of providers from which to choose. So how do you know which one is the best for your pet? We reviewed 30 pet insurance providers for our guide on the best pet insurance. The factors we considered included, but were not limited to: We started by looking at what type of coverage each provider offers.

In an emergency, or even for routine care with some insurers, pet parents can reduce their financial burden. No, pet insurance isn't effective immediately.

Travel insurance acts as a personal safeguard, ensuring that unexpected events don't drain your wallet or ruin your trip. Not all travel insurance policies are created equal.

Imagine falling ill in a foreign country; daunting, right? A robust travel insurance plan ensures you don't have to worry about how muchemergency medical care while travelingwill cost, even in the most remote corners of the globe. This coverage will often come in tandem with emergency medical evacuation coverage. Life is full of surprises, some less pleasant than others.

You can find our guide on thebest CFAR travel insurance companieshere. Losing your belongings is more than an inconvenience; it's losing a piece of your world. Insurance that covers personal belongings and baggage loss ensures that you're compensated for your loss, helping you to rebound and continue your adventure. In times of trouble, having a lifeline can make all the difference. Look for insurance that offers 24/7 support and assistance services, giving you peace of mind that help is just a phone call away. Also, check websites that field customer reviews like Trustpilot, the Better Business Bureau,SquareMouth, andInsureMyTrip, to see how well a company responds to customer requests. A provider's reputation is not just about being well-known; it's about reliability, customer satisfaction, and the ability to deliver on promises. Researching and choosing a reputable provider is a cornerstone in ensuring your safety and satisfaction. The devil is in the details, and understanding the fine print ofwhat your travel insurance policy coversis crucial. Be aware of coverage limits, exclusions, and the process for filing a claim to avoid any unpleasant surprises. For example, to get coverage for a canceled trip due to work, many travel insurance companies require that you've been with that company for at least a year. In the age of information, customer reviews and feedback are goldmines of insight. Learn from the experiences of others to gauge the reliability and customer service of the insurance provider you're considering. While the ratings are important, you should also look at whether or not a company responds to customer complaints. Familiarize yourself with every aspect of your policy — what it covers, what it doesn't, how to file a claim, and who to contact in an emergency. Being informed means being prepared. At the very least, you should have the terms readily available while you're on your trip. If you face an issue during your travels, knowing the immediate steps to take can make all the difference. Your insurance company may even have a 24/7 assistance hotline that can walk you through an emergency during your trip, even issues that don't involve claims. When a problem arises. you'll want to document as much as possible, in case you need proof when filing a claim. Ask for receipts and invoices when possible. There isn't a one-size-fits-all policy that works perfectly for every traveler. Young, healthy solo travelers often have a wider selection of offers, as their premiums are lower. If they're not participating in adventure activities, plans that offer bare-bones coverage will be best for them. On the other hand, families juggling complex itineraries will do best by investing in a robust policy that can help defray any costs associated with lost baggage, delayed transportation or other trip-impeding obstacles. That being said, you can't go wrong with a travel insurance provider that boasts a reputable history and offers a wide range of customizable plans. In some cases, you may be comparing plans that are only a few dollars' apart from each other. In such situations, you should generally opt for the insurance company that offers the strongest customer service. It's also worth considering whether or not the travel insurance provider has been reviewed by other travelers with similar itineraries to your own. An insurance aggregator like InsureMyTrip or SquareMouth is one of the best tools for searching travel insurance policies. Once you input the specifics of your travel itinerary, you'll be able to see hundreds of search results to compare the ones that catch your eye. If the options are too overwhelming, use the filters to the left of your search page to eliminate as many irrelevant plans as possible. To come up with our list of the best travel insurance companies, Business Insider evaluated each insurer based on the following factors: Travel insurance is essential, but often underused partly because people aren't getting what they want.Business Insider's 2023 travel studyshowed 10.65% of travelers surveyed bought cancel for any reason insurance. Cost may be a factor, but in many cases, the coverage is more reasonable than you might think. Regardless, companies must offer a diverse range of coverage options. We award five stars to companies offering all standard coverages and additional options like pet and sports equipment protection. Our 2023 travel study indicated the majority of purchases were made through the travel provider (ex: flight protection insurance when you're purchasing your airline tickets). While these may be sufficient for some customers, we look for companies offering a more comprehensive range of services. According to the U.S. Travel Insurance Association, the average cost of travel insurance will be between 4% and 8% of total travel expenses. Anything beyond that price point should include additional benefits beyond the standard inclusions, such as CFAR protection or upgraded medical coverage. Anything below that 4% threshold may leave you lacking important or sufficient coverage in an emergency. Whether you're an infrequent traveler or a suitcase warrior, a good travel insurance company should have you covered. In many cases, you might not even have to talk to a person in order to purchase your policy. Many people think of travel insurance in context with specific trips, but most of these top contenders sell both single-trip and multi-trip policies, also known as annual travel insurance. Some companies also offer plans specifically designed for cruisers, students abroad, and business travelers. (Read our guide to thebest cruise travel insurance companiesfor more details.) Finally, all of these providers offer multiple options for getting the specific areas and amounts of coverage that you want. Most travelers never have a large claim. Premiums are low, and it provides peace of mind for the just in case situations. So they leave reviews based on their reduced stress levels. But what happens if you lose your luggage or have to stay a few extra days due to an unexpected accident? Will your insurance carrier cover your claim without all the hassle? We check real customer reviews to sort this out for you. When purchasing, during your trip, and throughout the claims process, you may need extra support. Does the company have a 24/7 help line? Does it have an online or mobile system allowing you to self-manage? Essentially, what are the options when you need help? We look at the big picture to evaluate the average customer experience with each company. You can read more abouthow Business Insider rates travel insurancefor even more details. Business Insider's overall best travel insurance provider is Nationwide for its breadth of coverage options. AIG Travel Guard, AXA, C&F Travel Insured, Tin Leg, WorldTrips, and Trawick also made the cut. While coverage varies by policy, common exclusions often include pre-existing medical conditions (unless you have purchased a waiver), accidents caused by high-risk activities if not specifically covered (e.g., skydiving, scuba diving), travel for medical procedures, and events known before purchasing the policy (e.g., traveling during a pandemic). Always read your policy carefully to understand the exclusions. You can find the right travel insurance by considering the benefits most important to you, whether you want to prioritize medical coverage or trip cancellation. Regardless, pay attention to customer ratings and reputation. Theaverage cost of travel insuranceis $318.12, but your premium will depend on the trip you take. Travel insurance is usually 4% to 8% of your trip's cost. Yes, travel insurance typically offers some coverage of canceled flights, but if this benefit is important to you, make sure you read the fine print of your policy to make sure it offers adequate reimbursement.

JPMorgan staff are using a private chat to vent about the incoming RTO mandate — and share intel,"In a private group chat formed after JPMorgan's January announcement that all employees would be called back to the office full-time, a few hundred people have turned to the forum to air their concerns, vent about the changes, and share tidbits of intel from their respective corners of the bank in a bid to understand the bank's plans. The ""extremely active"" chat gets upward of 100 messages a day, according to one member, a JPMorgan employee of 8 years, who talked to Business Insider. It is one of many Signal chats and Reddit threads that JPMorgan employees are turning to as unofficial ""support groups"" for employees. ""There's a depressingly small amount of official information within JPMC,"" they said, expressing their concern about the lack of emails about what's happening. ""We have to go find the information, it is not being broadcast."" Last week, a document with JPMorgan branding was shared with the group and caused an instant hubbub, a different member of the chat told BI, which viewed the contents. It appeared to be an outline of steps of escalation for employees who don't meet RTO mandates, including a lower number of non-attendance warnings before possible termination for some. BI was unable to verify the authenticity of the document or determine who dropped it in the encrypted chat. It is also unclear if it represents current or future bank policy. What is clear based on chat members' reactions to the 6-page outline is that JPMorgan Chase employees are hungry for any clues to how the bank will enforce its 5-days-in-office policy, which began rolling out March 3. A JPMorgan spokesperson declined to comment on the specifics of the document but said, ""If employees are not meeting the expectations, there will be ramifications — just like any other performance issue."" Employees are also eager to understand how their attendance is monitored. Some worry that company tracking methods might not correctly record their hours or productivity — putting them at risk of potential enforcement. Others feel the RTO mandates and attendance recording measures are overkill. The employees were granted anonymity by BI to discuss internal company information without professional repercussions. One JPMorgan tech VP told BI, sarcastically, that they thought the ""babysitting was ending."" People in the aforementioned group chat have been sharing intel about tools for surveilling employee location and productivity. An employee who BI did not speak with shared that their manager had shown them a new tool with a heat map that shows how productive employees are based on the items worked on per hour. A technologist who has direct knowledge confirmed to BI the existence of a tool that tracked productivity per hour. It is unclear how widely it had been rolled out. ""It's impossible to put a number on productivity on a minute-by-minute basis,"" a software engineer in the group chat told BI. ""So much of what we do is about communication, learning, planning, and investing. The only quantifiable measures take weeks to materialize."" JPMorgan said it has ""no firmwide heat map that tracks individual production volumes."" ""For several years now, we have had a transparent attendance tool that is available for all employees and managers to view and record their time, including vacation days, sick days, work from home, and travel,"" the bank spokesperson said. The software engineer and the technologist both described color-coded calendars on manager dashboards that show employees' attendance, highlighting patterns such as requesting to work from home every Friday or calling in sick every Thursday. The chat-group document mentioned such patterns as grounds for managers to open HR cases against workers. JPMorgan also has a long-standing tracking tool,Workplace Activity Data Utility, also known internally as WADU. While these types of surveilling mechanisms aren't new at JPMorgan, asBI has previously reported, they add tension to an already fraught situation around the return to office. JPMorgan's RTO roll-outhas been met withpraise, disdain, and confusion. Bank employees said some offices didn't have enough desks, parking, or conference rooms, and that the messaging felt rushed and unplanned. In itsmemoannouncing the mandate, the bank acknowledged that capacity restraints would mean that some offices aren't yet ready, and are maintaining their hybrid in-office policies, working one or two days from home until further notice. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimonsaid in a February interview with CNBC that he's aware this strict policy could result in employees leaving the company and that he's fine with that attrition. But not everyone who's unhappy about the 5-day RTO is considering leaving the company. Some employees are exploring the possibility of a union and are working with Communications Workers of America, an organization that led the effort of around two dozen Wells Fargo branches unionizing, as BI previously reported.

M&A and IPOs slump under Trump: 'It's almost as bad as Covid.',"Wall Street'sdreams of a dealmaking reboundhave been put on hold over Trump's tariff turmoil. Investment bankers welcomed 2025 with high hopes that Trump's business-friendly, antiregulation policies would lead to a surge in fee-generating deals. Instead, many corporate boards and buyout firms are standing on the sidelines as they wait to see the impact Trump's aggressivetrade policiesandgutting of federal agenciescould have on the economy and stock market. How bad things are depends on who you ask. Some bankers said corporate dealmaking has merely slowed, while others described Wall Street's bread-and-butterbusiness of M&Aand IPOs in more dire terms. What's clear is that no one knows when — or whether — the clouds might lift, raising questions about everything from bonuses to layoffs to hiring. ""A common refrain I hear amongst dozens of sponsors over the last six to eight weeks,"" said Seth Goldblum, whose firm provides deal advisory services to private equity firms, is that ""the uncertainty in and of itself is actually the worst thing."" ""A lot of our sponsors are just sitting on the sideline,"" he said, referring toprivate equity firms, which are often referred to as financial deal sponsors. The managing director for CBIZ Private Equity Services pointed to the negative impact Trump's tariffs could have on inflation and interest rates as among the issues holding firms back. ""It's a shame. It looked like we were finally getting unstuck,"" Goldblum said, adding that the deals industry now appears ""back to being stuck."" Rob Stowe, an equity capital markets banker with Barclays, agreed that 2025 has proved more challenging than many in his field anticipated. ""We are still seeing companies coming to market, and we still expect we'll see companies coming to market, but it's definitely making decisions harder, and it's adding an extra element of caution for corporates and the sponsors that are thinking about raising capital,"" said Stowe, who heads the division that handles IPOs for the bank's Americas region. Eric Li, who covers investing banking for research firm Crisil Coalition Greenwich, said his discussions with clients suggest a more dire picture. Dealmaking, he said, has largely ""frozen."" ""There aren't any deals going on,"" Li said. ""It's almost as bad as Covid,"" he added, referring to the dealmaking stoppage that followed widespread stay-at-home orders in 2020 as the deadly virus spread across the globe. According to the consulting and advisory firm EY, Wall Street started the year strong. In January, there was a29% year-over-year increasein mergers and acquisitions in the US, valued at more than $1 billion. The consulting firm's M&A data has yet to be released for February, however, and that is when the stock market started reacting negatively to Trump's trade policies, sending the S&P 500 down roughly 10% since a high set on February 19 and about 8% since Trump was sworn in on January 20. On Wall Street, the big question is what it all means for the bottom line — and how it will impact pay and jobs. At the end of 2024,investment banks were hiringaggressively as dealmaking heated up in anticipation of a Trump White House. Now, there are questions about whether the momentum will continue. Brianne Sterling, head of the investment-banking recruiting practice at the financial services search firm Selby Jennings, said hiring hasn't reached thegangbuster levels some had hopedto see when the year started. She said some clients are still interviewing new hires even if they've indicated they'll push off the timeline for filling open roles till later in the year in hopes of improved market conditions. ""I think we will still see hiring,"" she said. ""I just don't think it'll be as aggressive or as much volume as we initially anticipated, but we'll see how the year goes."" Even amid rosier expectations many banks were focused on cutting costs this year, including Goldman Sachs. As Business Insider previously reported, CEO David Solomon hastasked some stafferswith finding ways to save money, including by reducing redundancies and moving workers tocheaper locations like Dallas, Texas. The bank's vice president rankshave been targetedfor cuts because their numbers have gotten bloated. The bank even moved its annual headcount-cutting exercise from fall to spring, when it is set to cut roughly 3% to 5% of its workforce, which stood at 46,500 as of the end of 2024. Bank of America has also recently cut investment banking roles, including positions in New York, a person familiar with the cuts said. The more recent round of layoffs primarily impacted junior bankers, such as analysts and associates — though some may be reassigned to other roles within the firm, added the person. Earlier this year, the bank also cut more senior positions in a round that amounted to under 1% of the bank's workforce in global markets and global corporate and investment banking, this person added. The cuts were first reported byReuters. Sid Khosla, a financial services executive at EY who serves as the firm's banking and capital markets leader, told BI that such layoffs are part of what he calls ""the efficiency conversation"" among companies seeking to please shareholders — a trend that started before Trump took office. The topic has come up increasingly in talks with clients, particularly in the past three to four months, Khosla said. ""It's always the top two or three conversations. Some institutions may think it's a No. 1 conversation."" Whether corporate dealmaking picks back up depends on how long the turmoil lasts, bankers said. ""I think any reasonable outlook is going to be a little clouded here for a while because there's no certainty that the conversations around tariffs and the concerns around the US economy or around interest rates are going to stop,"" said Stowe, adding: ""I also don't think there's any certainty that the current level of volatility will dissipate in the near term.""

Citi snags AI leader from Morgan Stanley to help turn around its wealth tech,"Citi's wealth boss, Andy Sieg,is bringing in a Morgan Stanley technology leader to strengthen the bank's offering in the ultra-competitive race to manage wealth clients' money. The bank has hired Dipendra Malhotra as head of wealth technology, according to a person familiar with the matter. Malhotra is joining Citi in late-May after 11 years at its rival, Morgan Stanley, where he led the bank's AI, machine learning, analytics, and data for its wealth management business. Improving technology and digital offerings withinCiti's wealth management unithas been a top priority for Sieg, who Citi CEO Jane Fraser tapped in 2023 to turn the wealth unit around. Citibank has struggled with its tech over the years, a problem that has extended to its wealth business. An internal audit conducted by Ernst & Young estimated that it would cost the bank at least $500 million to fix its patchwork of tech systems, Business Insider reported last year. Still, it's an area where Sieg is hoping to gain some ground. Citi's technology and operating platform ""has been a limiting factor in this business,"" Sieg said at the BofA Securities Financial Services Conference in February. He has confidence thatFraser's transformation initiative, and its focus on data quality, is fortuitous for his business, adding that ""we're setting the stage for us to be able to compete in a very different way to put work"" for both clients and advisors. While at Morgan Stanley, Malhotra was responsible for developing and maintaining data, AI, and machine learning tech for its wealth business.Morgan Stanleymade headlines as one of the first Wall Street firms to partner with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which has afforded its financial advisors with generative AI tools to help lessen drudge work. When Malhotra joins Citi in a few months, he'll report directly to itschief information officer, Jonathan Lofthouse. Lofthouse became the bank's CIO when he absorbed the co-CIO position held by Shadman Zafar until he departed the bank in February. At Citi, Malhotra is tasked with spearheading the modernization of its wealth technology, according to an internal memo from Lofthouse, seen by BI. He'll be working closely with two relatively new faces at Citi, Eric Lordi, a former JPMorgan executive, who heads up the wealth platform and experience and joined in January, and Joe Bonanno, who was named Citi's head of data, analytics, and innovation in July. ""Technology is the backbone of our ability to serve clients today and in the future, especially in an industry that is evolving at an unprecedented pace,"" Lofthouse said in the memo about Malhotra. ""To make sure we are providing the absolute best wealth experiences for our clients, our technology must be nothing short of industry-leading,""",https://www.businessinsider.com/citi-wealth-tech-hire-ai-dipendra-malhotra-2025-3
"The list of major companies laying off staff this year, including Porsche, Wayfair, Starbucks, and Meta","Layoffs and other workforce reductions are continuing in 2025, following two years of significantjob cutsacross tech, media, finance, manufacturing, retail, and energy. While the reasons for slimming staff vary, the cost-cutting measures are coming amid a backdrop of technological change. In a recentWorld Economic Forumsurvey, some 41% of companies worldwide said they expected to reduce their workforces over the next five years because of the rise of artificial intelligence. Companies such as CNN, Dropbox, and IBM have previouslyannounced job cutsrelated to AI. Tech jobs in big data, fintech, and AI are meanwhile expected to double by 2030, according to the WEF. Here are the companies with job cuts planned or already underway in 2025 so far. Adidas said in January that it would reduce the size of its workforce at its headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany, impacting up to 500 jobs,CNBCreported. If fully executed, it amounts to a reduction of nearly 9% at the company headquarters, which employs about 5,800 employees, according to the Adidas website. The news came shortly after the company announced it had outperformed its profit expectations at the end of 2024, touting ""better-than-expected"" results in the fourth quarter. ""Strong growth across all regions and divisions proves the good job our teams are doing across regions and functions,"" CEO Bjørn Gulden said in a press release. ""So although we are not yet where we want to be long term, I am very happy with this development which was much better than we had expected."" In a statement to BI, an Adidas spokesperson said the company had grown ""too complex because of our current operating model."" ""To set adidas up for long-term success,"" the spokesperson said, ""we are now starting to look at how we align our operating model with the reality of how we work. This may have an impact on the organizational structure and number of roles based at our HQ in Herzogenaurach."" The company said it is not a cost-cutting measure and that it could not confirm concrete numbers. The digital-financial-services company Ally is laying off roughly 500 of its 11,000 employees, a spokesperson confirmed to BI. ""As we continue to right-size our company, we made the difficult decision to selectively reduce our workforce in some areas, while continuing to hire in our other areas of our business,"" the spokesperson said. The spokesperson also said the company was offering severance, out-placement support, and the opportunity to apply for openings at Ally. Ally made a similar level of cuts in October 2023, theCharlotte Observerreported. BlackRock told employees it was planning to cut about 200 people of its 21,000-strong workforce,Bloombergreported in January. The reductions were more than offset by some 3,750 workers who were added last year and another 2,000 expected to be added in 2025. BlackRock's president, Rob Kapito, and its chief operating officer, Rob Goldstein, said the cuts would help realign the firm's resources with its strategy, Bloomberg reported. Jeff Bezos's rocket company, Blue Origin, is laying off about 10% of its workforce, a move that could affect more than 1,000 employees. Ina memosent to staff in February and obtained by Business Insider, David Limp, the CEO of Blue Origin, said the company's priority going forward was ""to scale our manufacturing output and launch cadence with speed, decisiveness and efficiency for our customers."" Limp specifically identified roles in engineering, research and development, and management as targets. ""We grew and hired incredibly fast in the last few years, and with that growth came more bureaucracy and less focus than we needed,"" Limp wrote. ""It also became clear that the makeup of our organization must change to ensure our roles are best aligned with executing these priorities."" The news comes after last month's debut launch of the company's partially reusable rocket —New Glenn. Boeingannounced on February 8 it plans to cut 400 roles from its moon rocket program amid delays and rising costs related to NASA's Artemis moon exploration missions. Artemis 2, a crewed flight to orbit the moon on Boeing's space launch system, has been re-scheduled from late 2024 to September 2025. Artemis 3, intended to be the first astronaut moon landing in the program, was delayed from late 2025 and is now planned for September 2026. ""To align with revisions to the Artemis program and cost expectations, we informed our Space Launch Systems team of the potential for approximately 400 fewer positions by April 2025,"" a Boeing spokesperson told Business Insider. ""We are working with our customer and seeking opportunities to redeploy employees across our company to minimize job losses and retain our talented teammates."" The company will issue 60-day notices of involuntary layoff to impacted employees ""in coming weeks,"" the spokesperson said earlier this month. Boeing cut 10% of its workforcelast year. BP told Business Insider in January that itplanned to cut 4,700 staffand 3,000 contractors, amounting to about 5% of its global workforce. The cuts were part of a program to ""simplify and focus"" BP that began last year. ""We are strengthening our competitiveness and building in resilience as we lower our costs, drive performance improvement and play to our distinctive capabilities,"" the company said. Bridgewater Associates cut 7%of its staff in January in an effort to stay lean, a person familiar with the matter told Business Insider. The layoffs at the world's largest hedge fund bring its head count back to where it was in 2023, the person said. The company's founder,Ray Dalio, said in a 2019 interview that about 30% of new employees were leaving the firm within 18 months. Oil giant Chevron plans to cull 15% to 20% of its global workforce by the end of 2026, the company said in a statementto Business Insiderin February. Chevron employed 45,600 people as of December 2023, which means the layoff could cut 9,000 jobs. The move aims to reduce costs and simplify the company's business as it completes its acquisition of oil producer Hess, which is held up in legal limbo. It is expected to save the company $2 billion to $3 billion by the end of 2026, the company said. ""Chevron is taking action to simplify our organizational structure, execute faster and more effectively, and position the company for stronger long-term competitiveness,"" a Chevron spokesperson said in a statement. The cuts follow a series of layoffs at other oil and gas companies, including BP and natural gas producer EQT. Cable news giantCNNcut about 200 television-focused roles as part of a digital pivot. The cuts amounted to about 6% of the company's workforce. In amemosent to staff on January 23, CNN's CEO Mark Thompson said he aimed to ""shift CNN's gravity towards the platforms and products where the audience themselves are shifting and, by doing that, to secure CNN's future as one of the world's greatest news organizations."" Cosmetics giant Estée Laudersaidin its second-quarter earnings release on February 4 that it will cut between 5,800 and 7,000 jobs as the company restructures over the next two years. The cuts will focus on ""rightsizing"" certain teams, and it will look to outsource certain services. The company says it expects annual gross benefits of between $0.8 billion and $1.0 billion before tax. Hewlett Packard Enterprise is cutting 2,500 jobs, or 5% of its employee base, CEO Antonio Neri said on an earnings call on March 6.The cuts are expected take to take place over the next 12 to 18 months. ""Doing so will better align our cost structure to our business mix and long-term strategy,"" Neri said. The company expects to save $350 million by 2027 because of the reduction. HPE plummeted about 20% after hours on March 6 after it said business would be affected by recent tariffs, slow server and cloud sales, and ""execution issues."" Johns Hopkins University will cut over 2,000 jobs after losing $800 million in funding from USAID. ""This is a difficult day for our entire community,"" a spokesperson told BI. ""The termination of more than $800 million in USAID funding is now forcing us to wind down critical work here in Baltimore and internationally."" The news comes after the Trump administration slashed USAID personnel downfrom over 10,000 to around 300. Secretary of State Marco Rubio recentlyconfirmedthat 83% of the agency's programs are now dead. ""We can confirm that the elimination of foreign aid funding has led to the loss of 1,975 positions in 44 countries internationally and 247 in the United States in the affected programs,"" the Johns Hopkins spokesperson said. ""An additional 29 international and 78 domestic employees will be furloughed with a reduced schedule."" The layoffs at Johns Hopkins represent the ""largest"" in the University's history, CNN reported. They'll primarily affect the schools of medicine and public health, along with the Center for Communication Programs and Jhpiego, a nonprofit with a focus on preventing diseases and bolstering women's health, according to the report. Department store Kohl's announced on January 28 that it reduced about 10% of its corporate roles to ""increase efficiencies"" and ""improve profitability for the long-term health and benefit of the business,"" a spokesperson told BI. ""Kohl's reduced approximately 10 percent of the roles that report into its corporate offices,"" the spokesperson said. ""More than half of the total reduction will come from closing open positions while the remainder of the positions were currently held by our associates."" Less than 200 existing employees of the company would be impacted, she added. This follows the company's announcement on January 9 that itwould shutter 27 underperforming storesacross 15 states by April. The retailer has been struggling with declining sales, reporting an 8.8% decline in net sales in the third quarter of 2024. Its previous CEO, Tom Kingsbury, stepped down on January 15. The company's board appointed Ashley Buchanan, a retail veteran who had held top jobs in The Michaels Companies, Macy's, and Walmart, as the new CEO. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told staff he ""decided to raise the bar on performance management"" and will act quickly to ""move out low-performers,"" according toan internal memo seen by BIin January. Those cuts started this month, according to records obtained by BI. Teams overseeing Facebook, the Horizon virtual reality platform, as well as logistics were among the hardest hit. Previously, the company had laid off more than 21,000 workers since 2022. Microchip Technology is cutting its head count across the company by around 2,000 employees, the semiconductor company said on March 3. The company estimated that it would incur between $30 million and $40 million in costs, including severance, severance benefits, and other restructuring costs. The cuts would be communicated to employees in the March quarter and fully implemented by the end of the June quarter. Last year, Microchip announced it was closing its Tempe, Arizona, facility because of slower-than-anticipated orders. The closure begins in May 2025 and is expected to affect 500 jobs. Microchip's stock had fallen over 33% in the past year. Microsoftcut an unspecified number of jobs in January based on employees' performance. Workers were told that theywouldn't receive severanceand that their benefits, such as medical insurance, would stop immediately, BI reported. The company alsolaid off some employeesin January at divisions including gaming and sales. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to say how many jobs were cut on the affected teams. Porsche said on March 12 that it plans to cut 3,900 jobs in the coming years. About 2,000 of the reductions will come with the expiration of fixed-term contractor positions, the German automakersaid Wednesday. The company will make the other 1,900 reductions by 2029 through natural attrition and limiting hiring, it said. Porsche said it also plans to discuss more potential changes with labor leaders in the second half of the year. ""This will also make Porsche even more efficient in the medium and long term,"" the company said. Bloombergreported in February that Salesforce, a cloud-based customer management software company, will slash more than 1,000 jobs from its nearly 73,000-strong workforce. Affected employees will be eligible to apply to open internal roles, the outlet reported. The company is currently hiring salespeople focused on the company's new AI-powered products. The cuts come despite Salesforce reporting a strong financial performance during its third-quarter earnings in December. Representatives for Salesforce did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Sonos, a California-based audio equipment company, said in a February 5 release that it's cutting about 200 roles. The announcement came nearly a month after Sonos CEO Patrick Spence stepped down from his position following a disastrous app rollout. The company's interim CEO Tom Conrad said in the statement that the layoff was part of an effort to create a ""simpler organization."" ""One thing I've observed first hand is that we've become mired in too many layers that have made collaboration and decision-making harder than it needs to be,"" Conrad said. ""So across the company today we are reorganizing into flatter, smaller, and more focused teams."" Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordanannouncedin February that the company is laying off 15% of its corporate staff, or about 1,750 employees. He said impacted workers will keep their pay, benefits, and bonuses through late April, when the separations will take effect. The companytoldinvestors the cuts would provide a ""partial year 2025 savings to be approximately $210 million and full-year 2026 savings to be approximately $300 million."" The move comes asSouthwesttries to cut costs amid profitability problems. Jordan said this is the first significant layoff the company has had in its 53-year history. An activist hedge fund took a stake in Southwest in June and has since helpedrestructure its boardandchange its business modelto keep up with a changing industry. For example, it plans to end its long-standing open-seating policy to generate more seating revenue. In recent months, the company has alsoreduced flight crew positionsin Atlanta to cut costs. Starbuckswill notify 1,100 corporate employees that they have been laid off on February 25. CEO Brian Niccol said in a memo that the layoffs will make Starbucks ""operate more efficiently, increase accountability, reduce complexity and drive better integration."" The layoffs won't affect employees atStarbucks stores, the company said. Niccol told employees that layoffs were on the way in a separate memo in January. The company is trying to improve resultsafter sales slidlast year. Payments platformStripe laid off 300 employees, primarily in product, engineering, and operations, according to a January 20 memo obtained by BI. Chief People Officer Rob McIntosh said in the memo that the company still planned on growing its head count to about 10,000 employees by the end of the year. The Washington Post eliminated less than 100 employees in an effort to cut costs,Reutersreported in January. A spokesperson told the wire service that the changes would occur across multiple areas of the business and indicated that the cuts wouldn't affect the newsroom. ""The Washington Post is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry, build a more sustainable future and reach audiences where they are,"" the spokesperson said, according to Reuters. Wayfairannouncedin an SEC filing on March 7 that it would eliminate its Austin Technology Development Center and lay off around 340 tech workers. The reorg comes as the technology team has accomplished ""significant modernization and replatforming milestones,"" the company said in the filing. Wayfair said it plans to refocus resources and streamline operations to promote its ""next phase of growth."" ""With the foundation of this transformation now in place, our technology needs have shifted,"" the company said. Wayfair expects to take on $33 to $38 millionin costs as a result of the reorganization, consisting of severance, cash employee-related costs, benefits, and transitional costs. Workday, the human-resources software company, said in February that it is cutting 8.5% of its workforce, or around 1,750 employees. The layoffs came as the company focuses more on artificial intelligence. In anoteto employees, CEO Carl Eschenbach said that Workday will focus on hiring in areas related to artificial intelligence and work to expand its global presence. ""The environment we're operating in today demands a new approach, particularly given our size and scale,"" Eschenbach wrote. He said that affected employees will get at least 12 weeks of pay.

"An early TikTok investor is $17 billion richer this year, making him the wealthiest man in finance after Warren Buffett","Many of the world's wealthiest people have takenheavy blows to their personal fortunesthis year as recession fears continue to weigh on stocks. Yet one Wall Street titan has leaped up the rich list, growing his net worth more than anybody else. Jeff Yass, the cofounder of Susquehanna International Group, has gained an unmatched $17.2 billion in wealth this year as of Wednesday's close, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. In contrast,Elon Muskhas had $113 billionwiped off his net worthasTeslastock has tanked 39% this year. Oracle'sLarry Ellison, Amazon'sJeff Bezos, Dell Technologies' Michael Dell, Alphabet's Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Nvidia's Jensen Huang, and Microsoft'sSteve Ballmerhave each had at least $12 billion of their wealth erased too. Yass' gain this year has boosted his personal fortune from about $47 billion to $63 billion, ranking him 23rd on the wealth index. He's now the richest man in finance after Warren Buffett, the fourth-biggest gainer with a$13.4 billion risethis year. The wealth surge for Yass, 66, stems from an early investment in ByteDance. Hestill owns about 7%of the Chinese social media company behind TikTok. ByteDance intends to repurchase employees' shares at a valuation of about $312 billion, up from $268 billion at the end of 2023, Bloomberg recently reported. Moreover,ByteDanceinvestors SoftBank, Fidelity, and T. Rowe Price have raised their internal valuation estimates to north of $400 billion. The upshot is Yass' reported stake may have jumped in value by roughly 50% in a little over a year. Susquehanna is also worth almost $50 billion, and Yass owns upward of 51% of the firm, regulatory filings show. Yass didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Yass is a Republican mega-donor who supported President Donald Trump's campaign. He's benefited from theUS leader's decisionto extend the deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok and its US operations over national security concerns. Trump said last year thatbanning TikTokwould make young Americans ""go crazy,"" and he didn't wantMark Zuckerberg's Meta to sweep in and take its place. Art Dantchik, who cofounded Susquehanna with Yass and is also a ByteDance director, has seen his wealth jump by $6.5 billion to reach almost $17 billion this year, putting him in 122nd place on the rich list. Yass, 66, is the son of two accountants and graduated as a math major, he says in a video on Susquehanna's YouTube channel. He moved to Las Vegas and spent about 18 monthsplaying pokerbefore becoming an independent options trader. After realizing how lucrative the sector was, he recruited his poker buddies from college to work at his own firm. Games remain a core part of Susquehanna's culture, according to its website. Employees can take part in board game nights, complete puzzles dotted around the office, and compete in an annual poker tournament.

PwC parted ways with 76 UK partners on New Year's Eve,"PwC's UK division closed out 2024 by parting ways with more than 70 partners as the consulting giant worked to weather a slowdown in the sector. TheBig Four firmcut 76 partners from its ranks in a single day on December 31, 2024, according to Business Insider's analysis of publicly available data. The end-of-year departures topped off a year that had already seen a larger than usual number of partners depart. A total of 124 partners left the firm in 2024, according to records at the UK's Companies House. In 2023 and 2022 combined, 103 partners left PwC's UK arm. In those two years, it also appointed more partners than it let go, adding 225 to its most senior ranks. Last year, the firm appointed 69 new partners. Companies House data says it has 987 active partners as of March 13. The Financial Times first reported on PwC's partner exodus. PwC, which doesn't provide reasons as to why partners leave the firm, declined to comment. Partners are the most senior employees at the Big Four consultancies. Those who hold equity ownership in the business traditionally receive a share of annual profits. Asmarket pressureshave weighed on the Big Four, partner numbers and their payouts have been falling. Partners at the UK wings of EY, PwC, and Deloitte all saw their pay fall last year as growth slowed. The high annual exit numbers come in the same year as Marco Amitrano was appointed to lead the firm's UK and Middle East operations. Amitrano, who took up the role in July, has launched an overhaul of operations in the UK. This includes creating a stand-alone technology and artificial intelligence unit and merging other parts of the business to create six new teams. He is also seeking to control costs amid an industry downturn. Growth at PwC's combined UK and Middle East divisions slowed by seven percentage points to 9% in 2024. From April 2025, it will be facing higher taxes per employee in the UK after the government increased the rate of national insurance contributions — a tax on earnings — that employers must pay. The firm has recently paused one of its apprenticeship schemes in the UK, from which it typically hires, according to a person familiar with the matter. BI understands that the ""flying start"" technology apprenticeship, which had offered opportunities to high school graduates since 2018, is no longer accepting applications. Have a tip?

Lone Pine 2.0: How the $18 billion Tiger Cub has changed since Stephen Mandel Jr.'s retirement,"Evolving into Lone Pine 2.0 following billionaire founder Stephen Mandel Jr.'s retirement in 2019 has been a ""heavy lift,"" according to theTiger Cub's co-CIO, Kelly Granat. Speaking on investor Patrick O'Shaughnessy'spodcastin a rare interview, Granat described how the firm, which was founded in 1997, has had to change from how it invests and how it runs its business because the world looks different than it did during former President Bill Clinton's second term. Lone Pine, which manages $18 billion and is run by Granat and fellow co-CIO David Craver, has had to focus on ""shoring up the organization for a different world,"" she said. The changes have paid off in the last two years when the manager made 20% in 2023 and 36% in 2024 in its long-short fund — but it hasn't been painless. Hedge funds have historically struggled with succession plans; Ray Dalio's Bridgewater churned through executives in different roles before he gave way forNir Bar Dea, who became the firm's CEO in 2022. Industry insiders gossip over the potential successors of firms likeElliott Managementand Millennium as their founders set up for the next generation but also show no signs of slowing down. For Lone Pine, it was always understood that Mandel would eventually hand over the reins, but the manager has still dealt withoutflows, a rough patch of performance, and the departure ofMala Gaonkar, one of the three people Mandel left in charge of the portfolio, in early 2022. Granat, a former Harvard tennis player who joined Lone Pine in 2007, described the ""resetting"" of the portfolio following 2022 — when its long-short fund fell 38% — as necessary. ""We had lost balance in the portfolio,"" she said. Lone Pine focused too much on the high-growth tech names, and, in the low interest rate environment following the pandemic, there was ""a lack of accountability around valuation."" Now, there's a focus on sectors they had experience in but had ignored, as well as a lower level of market exposure so the firm is more flexible. ""There are lots of ways to make money in the market, and we just got really narrow in our purview,"" she said. She's proud the ""breadth"" of the portfolio is driving returns now — the managermade 20% in 2023and 36% in 2024 in its long-short fund — not just a few stocks. Granat pointed out the firm didn't own Nvidia last year, for example. The portfolio's lower exposure level is partly to respond to structural market changes, such as the growth of passive and pod investing. Granat says the tweak helps them take advantage of times when stocks move for ""non-fundamental reasons,"" such as platforms unwinding positions or a change in which stocks are in indexes. The firm's changes are not limited solely to its investment staff. For the first time, Lone Pine is dedicating resources toward its public appearance and outreach, she said. ""We wouldn't do things like this five or 10 years ago,"" Granat said about speaking on a podcast. But ""the world's changed,"" and keeping their heads down and performing is no longer enough, even though the firm still enjoys a solid investor base of long-term investors like endowments and foundations, many of which have been with Lone Pine since inception. The firm brought onits first-ever business development leader, Pat Cronin, in 2022, and has attended events like iConnections to connect with potential LPs, for example. ""The onus is on us to tell our story,"" she said. ""There are other things we need to be doing to continue to develop and grow our business."" But if one thing has stayed the same at Lone Pine, Granat said, it's been the focus on the next generation. Mandel ""was focused at the beginning on the firm outliving him,"" she said, and she and Craver, who are both in their 50s, are continuing the tradition. ""If I'm in this seat in 10 years, that's probably not the best outcome for our LPs,"" she said.",https://www.businessinsider.com/how-lone-pine-has-changed-kelly-granat-2025-3
Google exec's 'most important lesson' from navigating the Great Recession is smart advice today,"Google executive Ruth Porat learned a thing or two from working through theGreat Recession. Her biggest piece of advice? Figure out where you're vulnerable and ""fortify"" against itbeforeyou're in crisis mode. Deeply embedded in Morgan Stanley during the recession, Porat said her experiences at the investment bank provided her with a playbook for hard times. ""There were a lot of really important lessons that came out of it, and when I got to Google, I was asked about them — which struck me as a bit odd, because Google had only seen sunny days,"" Porat said during an ""In Good Company""podcast interview. ""And I think, really importantly, the lessons are good for good times and bad."" Porat began her career at Morgan Stanley in 1987, spending 22 years in its investment banking division before serving as the bank's CFO from 2010 to 2015. During the 2008 financial crisis, Porat said she helped advise the US Treasury through the bailouts of insurance giant AIG and mortgage-financers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. As fears ofa possible recessionloom large on Wall Street, advice from those who've weathered them in the past may prove increasingly relevant today. Some of Porat's recommendations are applicable to the individual — not just the multinational conglomerate. ""The most important lesson from the crisis is to identify your greatest source of vulnerability ahead of time and protect against it,"" she said. For businesses navigating the financial crisis, that weakness in question was liquidity, according to Porat. ""I think a really important lesson for everyone is to do that question — what is your greatest source of vulnerability?"" she said. ""You can protect against it early on, but not in the moment."" In the case of institutions — Porat said it's best to load up on talent with the ability to take a broad view of things. ""Make sure you have a team with horizontal vision, because you've got to connect the dots across a lot of different issues,"" she said. And perhaps most crucially — there's no easy way out of a brutal situation, Porat said. It's best to just grit one's teeth and triage your way through it. ""I think the other really important lesson was that there are no good choices in a crisis,"" Porat said. ""And so go for the least worst and just keep moving, because standing still can actually just amplify, magnify — and you're not going to end up with a good solution in any event. By definition, you're in a crisis."" Afterward her time at Morgan Stanley, Porat transitioned into the same role at Google. Today, she serves as president and chief investment officer at the search giant and its parent company, Alphabet.",https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ruth-porat-lesson-great-recession-financial-crisis-advice-2025-3
"Billionaire Leon Black gave even more money to Jeffrey Epstein than we knew, Senate investigators say","BillionaireLeon Blackwas more responsible forJeffrey Epstein'svast fortune than previously known, according to a Senate committee investigation. Black, the billionaire financier and former CEO of Apollo Global Management, transferred $170 million to the Epstien's coffers over the course of five years, US Sen. Ron Wyden said in a letter to the US Justice and Treasury departments this week — not$158 million, as previously reported. An investigation commissioned by Apollo's board appears to have missed $12 million in transfers, which were discovered by investigators working on the US Senate Finance Committee. The Apollo investigation, conducted by the law firm Dechert LLP, led to Black's resignation in 2021 from the investment firm he cofounded. It also wasn't clear why the bank handling the $170 million in transfers didn't raise any flags until months after Epstein's arrest on sex trafficking charges in 2019, Wyden wrote. ""The Bank did not make filings related to the Black and Epstein transactions until seven years after the transactions began in 2013,"" Wyden wrote. ""In fact, the Bank first reported the payments from Black to Epstein more than eight months after Epstein was arrested on charges of sex trafficking involving underage girls."" Wyden, a Democratic lawmaker representing Oregon, asked US Attorney General Pamela Bondi and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to hand over documents related to the transfers by March 27, including from the trove of""Epstein documents"" that Bondi promised to make public. Black's relationship with Epstein came under scrutiny amid the accused sex trafficker's 2019 arrest and jail suicide. Epstein left an estate worth around $630 million around the time of his death, some of which has since been paid tocompensate his victims. According to the investigation commissioned by Apollo, Black paid Epstein for financial advice, including strategies that saved him around $600 million in estate and family trust tax payments. Epstein also helped manage issues related to Black's vast artwork collection, his yacht, and private jet, according to the Dechert report. The report also said Epstein and Black had a falling out in 2016 when Epstein believed he deserved more money. In his letter, Wyden expressed skepticism that the advice from Epstein — who dropped out from college — would be worth anything close to $170 million Black paid over five years. ""For his services Epstein was paid amounts that far exceeded what Black paid other professional advisors involved in his tax and estate planning, which includes some of the most high-priced legal counsel in the nation,"" Wyden wrote. ""At an annualized rate of $23 to $26 million per year, Epstein's compensation was higher than the median CEO pay for Fortune 500 companies."" One of Epstein's accounts that received money from Black, Financial Trust Company Inc., was previously used for Epstein's sex-trafficking operation, according to evidence filed inGhislaine Maxwell's sex-trafficking trial. Bank records made public in the trial ofMaxwell— who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for trafficking girls to Epstein for sex — show thatEpstein used the business to pay Maxwell. He transferred $30.7 million to Maxwell in the years they were together. Over $7 million of those funds were spent on a helicopter that accusers said Maxwell used to ferry girls to Epstein's private residence in the US Virgin Islands. In 2023, Black later paid $62.5 million to settle claims from the US Virgin Islands Attorney General's office related to ""how Jeffrey Epstein used the money Black paid him to partially fund his operations in the US Virgin Islands,"" according to a copy of the settlement Wyden made public. Representatives for Black, Apollo Global Management, and Dechert LLP didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Wyden's scrutiny of Black could complicate the Senate confirmation process of the Trump administration's nominees. President Donald Trump, who was friends with Epstein, selected Black's son, Benjamin Black, to lead the US International Development Finance Corp, also known as the DFC. According to Reuters, Trump has consideredconverting the DFC into a sovereign wealth fund, which he said could buy TikTok. The younger Black has also proposed repurposing funds fromUSAID, which was gutted by Elon Musk's DOGE initiative, to fund the DFC. Under Black's plan, the DFC would invest in developing nations to advance foreign policy goals rather than spend the money on aid.",https://www.businessinsider.com/leon-black-money-jeffrey-epstein-senate-investigation-2025-3
The internet is in awe of Warren Buffett's perfectly timed cash-out,"Warren Buffetthas sparked a raft of comments and memes on social media after the legendary investor sold most of his massive Apple stake and built a record cash pile before the stock market entered acorrectionthis week. Warren Buffett really sold the Apple top and stashed up $300 billion in T-bills before the worst drawdown in several years at 94 years old, goat Buffett'sBerkshire Hathawaynearly doubled its stockpile of cash, Treasury bills, and other liquid assets last year to $334 billion (or $321 billion if you subtract payables for T-bill purchases). Buffett sitting on $320 billion in cash:pic.twitter.com/MtTQhhugxL The conglomerate'scash hoardballooned largely because it sold a net $134 billion of stocks in 2024, and spent less than $3 billion on buybacks, halting them entirely in the second half. For comparison, it sold a net $24 billion of stocks and repurchased more than $9 billion worth of Berkshire stock in 2023. Warren Buffett looking at Berkshire Hathaway’s $334B of cash and t-bills — a 1/3rd of which was added in 2024 — as stocks are headed to a bear marketpic.twitter.com/AjKkgn0tO1 ""Despite what some commentators currently view as an extraordinary cash position at Berkshire, the great majority of your money remains in equities,"" Buffett reassured Berkshire shareholders in hisannual letterin February, referring to both the stocks and businesses that his company owns. Buffett didn't respond to a request for comment. Berkshire owned about 906 million shares of Apple worth $174 billion at the start of 2024, meaning the iPhone maker accounted for 49% of the total value of its stock portfolio. Over thenext nine months, it cut its top holding by 67% to 300 million shares, worth $75 billion at the end of December. Buffett and his team also pared their No. 2 holding,Bank of America, by 34% to 680 million shares in the second half of 2024, cutting the position's value from $41 billion to just under $30 billion. As of Thursday's close,Appleand Bank of America shares have dropped 19% and 17% each from their late-2024 highs. Warren Buffett watching the stock market collapse while holding $300 Billion in T-Billspic.twitter.com/dkf6z23d0c Apple is still up 9% since the start of 2024, however, meaning Buffett left money on the table by cashing out when he did. If he kept his stake intact throughout 2024 it would be worth around $190 billion. Bank of America is trading around the $40 mark, as it was at the end of June last year, meaning Buffett probably hasn't won or lost big from selling. There's nothing to say themarket sell-off, which has pulled the S&P 500 down 10% and the Nasdaq Composite down 14% from their record closes on February 19, won't worsen as the Trump administration's policies continue to fuel recession fears. Warren Buffett watching the stock market collapse while holding $300 Billion in T-Billspic.twitter.com/WLKRGjSCre Moreover, it's important to consider where Buffett has invested the sale proceeds.Owning Treasurysis more lucrative than in the past; the one-year yield has jumped from under 1% to over 4% in just over three years, primarily because rising inflation spurred the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to relieve upward pressure on prices. ""But I don't mind at all, under current conditions, building the cash position,"" Buffett said at Berkshire's annual meeting last year. ""I think when I look at the alternative of what's available in the equity markets, and I look at the composition ofwhat's going on in the world, we find it quite attractive."" Buffett is a long-term investor who's owned stocks such asCoca-Cola and American Expressfor decades. It's unlikely he pared his portfolio because he saw trouble coming and wanted to cash out before the next market crash — and he probably won't care much about a few months of stock performance. He's publiclysoured on banksand pointed to higher bond yields and the prospect ofsteeper taxes on capital gainsas two reasons he was happy to take some Apple profits and buy Treasurys instead. He's also explained his growing cash pile reflects a dearth of bargains with both private and public companies trading at heady valuations. Buffett walking into the Omaha office with 300B in T-bills this am...pic.twitter.com/aNbTFE2Pwu It's also worth noting that quarterly portfolio filings provide limited insight into an investor's strategy. They're only a snapshot of their holdings on a single day with a six-week lag, and they exclude shares sold short, foreign-listed stocks, private investments, and nonstock assets. Even if Buffett isn't selling stocks and stacking cash because he expects a market downturn, his bearish positioning could stillmake him a winnerif this one continues. Not only will the strategy temper the impact on his stock portfolio, but it means he'll have plenty of dry powder to deploy on cut-price businesses and discounted stocks, as he did during thefinancial crisis. Buffett's followers aren't only applauding the timing of his Apple sales and cash build. Probably in a bid to shore up market sentiment, they're quoting his famous advice to ""be greedy when others are fearful."" ""Be fearful when others are greedy.

Inside the stock contest a $23 billion hedge fund uses to recruit interns,"When Sophia Guiter arrived in New York City last October, it was her first time in the Big Apple. Despite the allure of Broadway, Times Square, and the city that never sleeps, the Milwaukee, Wisconsin, college student had a bigger mission: making an impression on executives of the $23 billion asset managerBalyasny. She and two of her Marquette University classmates were set to compete in the firm's first-ever US stock pitching competition the next day. Guiter's focus paid off: Her team placed third, and she scored an interview that led to aninternshipwith Balyasny's proprietary research team, set to start this summer. Balyasny, meanwhile, has now adopted the competition as a regular part of itsrecruiting pipeline. It held a second stock-picking contest at the end of February and plans to host two such competitions a year in the US from now on. In addition to prize money awarded to the top three teams, the top two teams, plus other standout students, are granted hard-to-get interviews forBalyasnyinternships. For example, six out of 15 participants from the February contest were interviewed for Balyasny's 2026 internship program. ""It's basically an early application pool for us, and we would love to be able to fill a good amount of our summer internship class via the stock pitch competition,"" said Hannah Dinardo, the firm's head of campus recruiting. Balyasny is just one of many ""buy-side"" firms ramping up campus recruitment — that is, getting talent in the door earlier through internships versus waiting until they've had job experience. In the past, hedge funds and private equity firms recruited almost exclusively frominvestment banks. But campus recruiting has become increasingly important to the sector, which has ballooned in size in recent years due to growing interest in their investments. ""Having a cohort of young talent — I don't want to say that it's inexpensive, but it's anearlier investment,"" explained Steve Schurr, a Balyasnyportfolio managerwho conceived of the stock-picking competition as a talent pipeline. Today, most of Schurr's 10-person team counts Balyasny as their first job out of college, he said. Guiter, Schurr, and Dinardo sat down with Business Insider to give their advice on how college students interested in afinance careercan get invited to the competition and make an impression on the asset manager's top execs once there. Here's how it works: Balyasny recruiters, including Dinardo, identify campus clubs with students they can invite to submit stock pitches, which act as applications to the competition. The firm prioritizes sophomores. Pitches are reviewed blind, meaning the school names are withheld until the final selection round. Then, five schools are invited to and hosted in New York to participate in an in-person competition. At the event, student teams present their pitches to the judges — who are also portfolio managers — and the other teams for 10 minutes, followed by a seven-minute Q&A. In addition to traditional Wall Street target schools, Dinardo says the firm also aims to includelesser-known universitieslike Marquette University — a small private school in Wisconsin. (The winners of last year's competition hailed from The University of Alabama.) ""It's such a great way to evaluate students' skill set through their work product and to really see how they're thinking about markets, how they're thinking about stocks, and just see them in a totally different light versus just a one-to-one interview,"" said Dinardo. ""You're able to also, from a recruiting perspective, see how they stack up against their peers."" Key to scoring an invite is being in the right college clubs. ""The competition as a whole has been really helpful for us to better understand where we're spending our time on campus and which groups really align well with what we're looking for,"" Dinardo said. She advises students whose groups aren't yet on their radar to hone in the club's educational program and mission. ""Think about the curriculum of the club. Is it a group where students by their sophomore year are going to be prepared to compete and participate in a competition like this?"" she said, adding: ""Are they well versed in diligencing an idea soup to nuts and from start to finish being able to build out a stock pitch and an investment pitch?"" In choosing which clubs to work with, Dinardo also looks at a club's relationship with its members, preferring a loyal base versus a handful of students aiming to fill out their resumes. ""A one-semester engagement opportunity on campus to build out your resume and get on an email distro list. I would say that's typically what we try to avoid,"" she said. It can be hard to juggle classes, jobs, friends, and other club commitments, but Guiter advises students prioritize the stock-picking competition if they want to succeed. ""We were putting in over 80 hours a week, especially that last week,"" Guiter said. I mean, we'd wake up in the morning and we would work on that until we went to bed. We were really focused on it and really wanted to stand out to the judges and come as prepared as possible."" She had never worked so hard on anything in her time as a student. ""It was definitely the most I've ever juggled on my plate at one time, but worth every minute of it."" Rehearse presenting your ideas and answering questions as much and as often as possible. ""Don't show up and have only practiced your pitch like, three times,"" Guiter said. She and her team did multiple run-throughs in front of their entire investment club and professors. ""We'd go up during class or have Friday pitches where people would come, and they would just grill us,"" she said. ""There was a time where it went on for an hour and a half."" Ahead of the competition, the top five teams get a 45-minute pitch revision session with members of Balyasny's analyst development team to prepare for the final event and get a better sense of the types of questions they might be probed on. Balyasny doesn't give students tight parameters for picking a stock, just a market cap amount. So when thinking about which equity they'd showcase, Guiter and her team went for something they thought would be a less popular choice: a healthcare stock. ""We wanted to branch out from the tech and AI space because we figured a lot of our competitors would choose a stock within that space,"" she said. ""We wanted to differentiate within a market that has a lot of research that we could build off of."" Indeed, the skill set required to be a successful equity investor is ""evolving rapidly,"" said Schurr. ""You need to have a high degree of creative intelligence. You need to be a really independent thinker, but you also have to have an adaptive mindset,"" he said. Guiter and her teamused ChatGPTto assist with the extensive research project and show they could harness technology. ""We analyzed how often management fulfilled their promises by analyzing 10 years of earning calls,"" she said. Looking back, Guiter said her group should've included more details about the time spent on the project as well as their research approach when delivering their 10-minute pitch. It's something she now encourages other students to do. Indeed, Shurr (who was a judge at her competition) said he is looking to hear about research processes and conclusions that say something interesting. Even if the judges don't agree with the stock call, this will give them insight into the process. Schurr added that successful teams ""did a deep amount of interesting and variant work and could articulate their thoughts quite well about the nature of the business and where they believe the perception was misplaced,"" he said. ""And they could show their work."" This focus helps him and other PMs determine the competition winners and identify which students to invite to Super Days. ""Really what you're trying to do with this is not identify one great idea, you're trying to identify someone who has an innate strength as a sleuth to go and dig for information in a unique way,"" he said.

"The career rise of billionaire Steve Cohen, the hedge fund legend who owns the Mets","Billionaire Steve Cohen is known on Wall Street for being one of its most successful traders. The 68-year-old runs the $39 billion hedge fund Point72 Asset Management and was famously dubbed the ""hedge fund king"" in 2006 due to his grand slam returns. Cohen started his first hedge fund, SAC Capital Advisors, in 1992 with $25 million and grew into a financial behemoth. Cohen, however, eventually found himself in a legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission over insider trading and fraud charges against his firm in 2012. As part of a $1.8 billion settlement in 2013, the firm pleaded guilty to insider trading and Cohen agreed to an SEC ban on managing outside investments for a period of time. In 2014, he converted SAC into a family office and launched its successor, Point72 Asset Management. The firm began managing outside money when Cohen's SEC ban lifted in 2018. But Cohen's name isn't just known within the world of finance. After years of owning a small stake in the New York Mets, he bought the team for $2.4 billion in 2020. Since then, his reputation as an intense businessman has shifted to that of apassionate owner in the Major Baseball League. Here's a look at the career rise of the legendary hedgefunder. Cohen was one of eight children born to a piano teacher and a garment manufacturer. In high school, the billionaire worked at a supermarket, Bloomberg reported. He studied economics at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. Outside of class, he traded stocks and beat his friends at poker. He was in a fraternity, too. He joined the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity. Cohen loved stocks so much that he would trade them in between his classes, according to a 2003 Bloomberg Businessweekprofile. In his spare time, he would also beat all of his friends at poker. After graduating in 1978, he went to Wall Street to work for at boutique investment banking and brokerage firm Gruntal & Co. as a junior trader in the options arbitrage group. His beginnings on Wall Street inspired a legend that he made $8,000 his first day and was bringing in around $100,000 each day. He became a star at Gruntal and by 1984, he started running his own group of traders. He launched his own hedge fund in 1992. Cohen rented office space nine floors above Gruntal to start his own $25 million hedge fund, SAC Capital. Some of his traders from Gruntal joined him there until SAC was headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. When he was 23, Cohen married Patricia Finke. They had two children together and got divorced in 1988. In 2009, Finke sued Cohen, alleging that he hid millions from her and some of that money had come from insider trading in RCA shares back in 1985 before it was acquired by General Electric, DealBookreported. A spokesperson at the time called the allegations ""ludicrous"" and ""without merit."" The case was ultimately dismissed in 2011. He met his current wife, Alexandra Garcia, through a dating service in 1991.Alexandra was a single mom of Puerto Rican descent who grew up in Washington Heights. They married in 1992 and have four children together. In 1998 and 1999, SAC delivered 70% annual returns. Then, in 2000, his hedge fund bet against tech stocks and brought in 70% returns again. Back in 2006, WSJreportedthat SAC's trading accounted for 2% of all of the stock market activity. This would make them a desired client on the Street. Cohen wasn't charged with any wrongdoing in an insider trading case against former CR Intrinsic (a subsidiary of SAC) portfolio managerMathew Martoma.However, SAC Capital pleaded guilty to securities fraud and agreed to pay a $1.8 billion fine in 2013. Cohen agreed to turn SAC Capital into a family office in 2013. In 2014, the firm rebranded with a new name: Point72 Asset Management. During this time, it managed the assets of Cohen, his family, and eligible employees. In 2016, Cohen reached a settlement with the SEC over charges that he failed to supervise one of his portfolio managers. Cohen did not admit or deny the charge. As part of the settlement, he agreed to not manage outside capital for two years. The move was seen as his official comeback in money managementafter SAC's legal troubles. He formedStamford Harbor Capitalto invest in private funds. As Cohen sent out pitches for his new fund, anticipation for its launch grew. Two years later, Stamford Harbor Capital merged with Point72 to begin accepting outside capital, raising $5.7 billion over the course of 2018, the company said on itssite. Cohen played poker in high school. ""It's the same with trading. I think about the risk. I think about the trade. I don't think about the money. Poker—that was the biggest determinant in my learning to take risks,"" he told Vanity Fair in 2010. However, a spokesperson told BI that he no longer plays the card game. Today, he's known for his prominent art collection, which he's been adding to since 2000. His impressive collection, which was said to be worth around $1 billion at one point, includes pieces by Monet, Picasso, Jasper Johns, Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst, Willem de Kooning, Francis Bacon, and Andy Warhol, according to a 2010 Vanity Fairprofile. In 2022, Cohen's philanthropic foundation,The Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation, celebrated donating more than $1 billion since its formation in 2001. Cohen grew up watching Mets games. In February 2012, hereportedlybought a 4% stake in the MLB team for $20 million. He purchased 87% of the Mets for $2.4 billion in 2020. He's one of the richest owners in the league, and he's known to engage with fans online. It seemed to be a good year for Cohen. Point72 surpassed $20 billion in assets, and the public perception of Cohen began to change. He was once known as a hedge fund shark, but he gained a following of Mets fans on X, then Twitter, after becoming the team owner. In the period leading up to opening day of the MLB 2023 season, Cohen committed over $806 million in contracts to nine players. The Mets' project player payroll for that year was $377 million, Forbesreported. On the finance side, Point72 surpassed $30 billion in assets in July 2023. Cohen stepped away fromtrading his bookfor Point72 in favor of mentoring emerging investors. ""Point72 continues to be Steve's primary focus and he's as engaged as ever. The only change here is that he will spend less time in front of his computer screens and more time working with investment teams and developing talent at the firm,"" a previous statement from a firm spokesperson said. The firm had previously established thePoint72 Academy in 2015, which trains undergraduates to be investment analysts, andLaunchPoint, thehedge fund's incubator for top analysts ramping up to run money. Point72 launched Turion, a fund dedicated to artificial intelligence, in October 2024. It's run by portfolio manager Eric Sanchez, and it posted a 14% gain within months of starting out with expectations of growing to $1.5 billion.

March is off to a painful start for big-name hedge funds,"Last month was one of the worst in a long time forbig-name hedge fundssuch as Izzy Englander's Millennium and Steve Cohen's Point72. March could be even worse. Early monthly returns for large multistrategy firms show industry-wide pain thanks to the market volatility brought on by President Donald Trump and his administration's policies toward trade. These managers haveamassed never-before-seen scale and headcountsover recent years because of their ability to make money no matter the market conditions. But people close to these managers said Millennium, Point72 and Schonfeld have all lost money in March as momentum-linked trades, such as index rebalance strategiesthat stung Millennium last month, continue to unwind, and stocks fall across the board. These people said Millennium and Point72 were each down 1.4% for March through last Thursday. This was before Monday's market moves, which saw the tech-heavy Nasdaq index have its worst trading day since 2022. Even a bright spot for the year among the big-name multistrategy firms has had a rough start to March. Schonfeld, which was flat in February, has lost 1.2% this month through last week's end, according to a person close to the firm. The managers mentioned declined to comment. ""If you see a long/short equity p.m. today give them a hug, they need it,"" wrote Benn Eifert, the cofounder of QVR Advisors, which runs volatility and derivatives strategies, on X Monday. Through the end of last week, the S&P 500 had fallen more than 3%, and the index lost another 2.7% on Monday in the worst trading day of the year, and more pain could be on the way. ""Markets are still richly valued, even if it does feel like we are at an inflection point,""Man Group wrotein a new post. Given bearish attitudes and ""sky-high valuations"" in the stock market, the London-based manager wrote, ""The fat lady may not have sung yet. But be under no illusion: the stage is set."" One of the biggest losers among large-cap stocks in recent weeks was ahedge fund favoritecoming into the year, adtech darling AppLovin. The stock in the portfolios of Tiger Cubs like Viking Global, Coatue, and Lone Pine at the start of the quarter is down more than 50% since its mid-February high. It's unclear if these funds were able to sell any or all of their stakes before the drop. Lone Pine and Viking declined to comment, while Coatue did not respond to immediate requests for comment. Markets were exuberant following Trump's election, as Wall Street believed his administration would cut regulation but not follow through with his tariff threats. However, as consumer confidence dips and geopolitical tensions rise, markets have begun to turn. Even supporters of the president, like billionaire Third Point founder Dan Loeb, are acknowledging that the markets under the current administration will be, at the very least, volatile. ""We are born alone; we die alone and we navigate the Trump stock market alone,"" Loeb posted on X Monday, in a twist on the well-known Orson Welles quote. His firm's publicly traded offering lost 2.3% in February and was down another 70 basis points after the first week of March.

"Tech billionaires are having a really, really rough 2025","Eight tech billionaires have seen their combined fortunes shrink by an estimated $266 billion this year as President Donald Trump's policies continue tospook investors. That figure exceeds the market value of most of America's largest companies including Salesforce, McDonald's, and Wells Fargo. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Muskleads the list of wealth losers, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The world's richest person has had $132 billion, or 30% of his fortune, wiped out in the past 10 weeks following the45% slide in Tesla stockin that period. Amazon'sJeff Bezos, Oracle'sLarry Ellison, Dell Technologies' Michael Dell, and Nvidia'sJensen Huanghave each seen more than $20 billion erased from their respective net worths this year as their companies'stock prices have tumbled. Amazon and Oracle are both down about 11%, while Dell and Nvidia have slumped by north of 20%. Rounding out the group are Alphabet cofoundersLarry PageandSergey Brin— down about $18 billion and $17 billion each this year following a 12% drop in shares ofGoogle's parent company—and Steve Ballmer, who's down about $13 billion after a 10% decline in Microsoft stock. The eight tech titans' collective net worth fell by $64 billion on Monday alone as the Nasdaq Composite slid 4%, itssteepest one-day loss since 2022. Thesell-off was sparkedby Trump cautioning there would be a ""period of transition"" for the US economy in a Fox News interview on Sunday. The president didn't rule out arecessionwhen asked if he expected one this year. He said his focus was on strengthening America and achieving long-term prosperity: ""You can't really watch the stock market."" Trump's sweeping economic agenda is focused on equalizing US trade relations using tariffs, curtailing immigration, lifting regulations, cutting taxes, and downsizing the federal government. His policies have reignited inflation fears andstoked recession worries. The increased uncertainty has dampened the buzz around AI that had lifted tech stocks and the wider market to record highs this year. One consequence is theworld's 16 wealthiest peopleare worth $236 billion less than they were at the start of January after a $87 billion decline on Monday, per Bloomberg's rich list. Microsoft'sBill Gatesand Meta'sMark Zuckerbergwere still up between $4 billion and $5 billion for the year at Monday's close. The Facebook cofounder took a $9.5 billion wealth hit on the day — second only to Musk's$29 billion blow. Three others on the list are in the green for 2025 as they're less exposed to tech:Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffettis up about $14 billion, while LVMH's Bernard Arnault and Inditex's Amancio Ortega are up between $6 billion and $7 billion. The richest of the rich shouldn't feel too sorry for themselves, as they had a stellar 2024. The top 10 billionaires at the end of December were up more than $500 billion for the year, and worth acombined $2 trillion— about as much as Amazon or Alphabet.",https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-billionaires-wealth-stocks-musk-trump-bezos-crash-recession-economy-2025-3
Wall Street is worried it can't keep up with AI-powered cybercriminals,"Generative AI could be one of the most promising tech advancements on Wall Street — but it may also turn out to be one of the most threatening. Bank leaders feel like they can't protect against what cybercriminals can do with generative AI, according to fresh data from Accenture based on a survey of 600 bank cybersecurity executives. Eighty percent of respondents believe generative AI is empowering hackers faster than their banks can respond. Cybersecurity is an important component of customer trust, Valerie Abend, Accenture's financial services cybersecurity lead, told Business Insider. ""The banks that really understand how important customer trust is, as their most valuable asset, and put cybersecurity right there as the core of the enabling that, those are going to be your winners,"" she added. Banks have toutedgenerative AI's abilityto make their workers more productive and efficient. The tech is being used to do everything from helpingsoftware developers write codeto enablinganalysts to summarizethousands of documents into research reports. But it's not just Wall Street workers who are using the tech to their advantage. Armed with generative AI, bad actors can ingest more data than before, and use the technology's ability to mimic humans to perform more sophisticated and realistic scams. These attacks, which are targeting customers, bank employees, and their technology providers, can have far-reaching consequences. Once criminals gain access, they can make fraudulent purchases, wire money, and drain customer accounts of funds. They can also gain deeper accessinto company tech stacks, steal data, and download malicious software. Bank leaders are not ignorant of what's at stake;JPMorganhas said it spends more than $600 million each year on cybersecurity, whileBank of America's cyber spend has surpassed $1 billion annually. Some key tech execs, likeGoldman Sachs's Stephanie CohenandBridgewater's CTO Igor Tsyganskiy, have even left the finance industry altogether to tackle the cyber threat of AI more directly at tech companies. But despite the millions of dollars banks spend to shore up their defenses, many IT execs believe the advancement of generative AI is too quick to keep up with. About a third of survey respondents (36%) said they believe they have a solid grasp of the rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape. To be sure,banks are using AIto detect vulnerabilities, offer up more robust threat intelligence reports, and try to get ahead of attacks by analyzing more real-time data, Abend said. They've also been using AI to identify so-called toxic combinations, like employees who have access to approve and execute transactions, including wire requests. But those efforts and the speed at which they can be deployed are greatly hampered by the strict regulations banks must follow, Abend said. Abend, who spent years working at regulators like the Office of the Comptroller of Currency and the US Department of Treasury, said in order to use AI banks need to demonstrate that they can maintain the controls and governance necessary to stay within their risk appetite. They have to be thoughtful about how they adopt AI, the large language models they use, how third parties provide these models, how they're protecting the data that feeds the models, and who has access to the output of those models. Cybercriminals are taking advantage of newer models, such as DeepSeek, to write malicious code and identify weaknesses, like identifying weak spots in the cloud security of a given IP address, Abend said. Established generative AI providers, like ChatGPT and Google Cloud, have blocked such activity, but newer models are still susceptible. There are fintechs and startups that are developing AI-powered tools to help banks thwart cyber attacks.Alloy, which works with M&T Bank and Navy Federal Credit Union, this week released a new product to detect attacks, identify suspicious volume spikes in applications, and reduce manual reviews during attacks. But bank vendors and technology providers could provide another opening to banks that bad actors are targeting. Over 70% of breaches at banks come from their supply chain of vendors, Abend said. Cybercriminals use generative AI models to sift through data to find out which companies partner with banks and exploit that vulnerability. Tech providers aren't held to the same regulatory standards as banks, and banks' third-party oversight management is often manual and with limited and old data, Abend said. ""The reality is, you can outsource the capability as a bank, you don't outsource the risk,"" Abend said. ""Customer trust is basically dependent on the bank to protect that customer's data and their financial information across the end-to-end supply chain."" Accenture research has found that maintaining customer trust helps banks achieve 1.5 times higher customer retention rates and 2.3 times faster revenue growth. ""This is not a back-office issue, banking executives really need to stop treating this like a compliance problem,"" she said.",https://www.businessinsider.com/banks-ai-cybersecurity-threats-hackers-generative-ai-2025-3
Jamie Dimon says it's only 'people in the middle' complaining a lot about RTO,"Jamie Dimon says that when it comes to RTO pushback, the usual culprits are ""the people in the middle."" The JPMorgan Chase CEO talked about the bank'sreturn-to-office mandatein a recent interview at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. ""If you work in a restaurant, you've got to be in. You all may not know this, but 60% of Americans worked the whole time,"" hesaid. ""Where did you get your Amazon packages from? Your beef, your meat, your vodka? Where did you get the diapers from?"" Dimon, whose heatedcriticisms of remote workhave made him a champion of the return-to-office culture shift, seemed to be talking about people who worked in person during the pandemic. ""You got UPS and FedEx and manufacturers and agriculture and hospitals and cities and schools and nurses and sanitation and firemen and military. They all worked,"" he continued. ""It's only these people in the middle who complain a lot about it."" White-collar workers, who generally have more freedom with where their work can be performed than frontline workers, have had various responses to return-to-office mandates in recent years. Some have pushed back or questioned such mandates or evenquit over them. JPMorgan Chase announced in January that it was requiring employees toreturn to the officefive days a week, starting in March. Dimon has said he understands enforcing RTO maydrive some employees to quit, but he's OK with that. ""I completely respect people that don't want to go to the office all five days a week. That's your right. It's my right. It's a citizen's right,"" he previously told CNBC. ""But they should respect that the company is going to decide what's good for the clients, the company, etc., not an individual."" Dimon also said one reason he wanted people back in the office was that ""younger people are being left behind,"" adding: ""To have the younger people coming in but not their bosses — I have a problem with that too."" JPMorgan Chase didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",https://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-jamie-dimon-only-people-in-middle-complain-rto-2025-3
"Private equity salaries: What Blackstone, Apollo, KKR, and more pay employees at all levels","In his 1987 classic, ""The Bonfire of the Vanities,"" Tom Wolfe referred to sell-side traders as ""masters of the universe."" Today, that phrase might best apply to the dealmakers who run the$15 trillion world of privatemarket investing. Private equity firms areincreasingly driving the world of corporate dealmakingas investors flock to the sector — a dynamic that helpedBlackstonebecome the world's largest alternative assets manager with over $1 trillion in assets. Even with the recent slowdown in the business of buying and selling companies for a profit, private equityremains a top career destination for many financial workers— much to thechagrin of banks. To get a sense of what private equity pays, Business Insider pulled publicly available data for 12 firms, includingBlackstone,Apollo, and KKR. We found that salaries often start at $100,000 for entry-level analysts and soar to over $500,000 for industry leaders, such as partners and managing directors. Salaries found included $195,000 for a senior associate covering real estate acquisitions and $450,000 for a vice president of capital and partner solutions. The data comes from a combination of job listings and H-1B visa data culled from theUS Office of Foreign Labor Certification's 2024 disclosures, which requires employers to list how much they expect to pay for certain jobs for foreign workers. The data only shows base salaries, but private-equity dealmakers, much like bankers, can also earn end-of-yearbonusesthat can double their salary, according to data from a pay survey conducted by recruiting firm Odyssey Search Partners. Additionally, some private equity professionals earnmoney from carried interest, a form of profit sharing for more senior employees. Odyssey's data, included at the end of this report, shows private equity partners and managing directors expected to earn at least $1 million in salary and bonus last year, while principals, which are one level below, anticipated earning up to $720,000. Companies named either did not respond to a request for comment or declined to provide comment. Apollo, founded in 1990, had $751 billion in assets under management as of the end of 2024 andplans to double that amount by 2029. While the company's largest strategy is credit, with $616 billion in assets under management, it also has a robust equity investment side with $135 billion in assets under management and ""real assets"" like real estate and infrastructure that make up the difference.

""Post-pandemic, private equity professionals' compensation increased due to a bullish market, robust deal activity, and higher pay at investment banks,"" Keizner wrote. ""This growth has now stabilized amid high interest rates, slower deal flow, and decreased demand for additional investment professionals as firms are typically focused on realizing current investments with their existing workforce and returning capital to LPs."" Of course, the real financial draw, he said, is ""on the potential longer-term value of carried interest,"" or profit-sharing.

"70 and job hunting: A boomer moved to Wyoming and still can't afford to live on her $2,000 in monthly Social Security","Shelley Janek, 70, hoped to retire with a strong nest egg at her age. Instead, she'spaying bills with Social Securityand looking for a job. Janek is one of millions of retirees navigating the risingcost of livingin the US. Business Insider has heard fromroughly4,000 older Americanswho are struggling to make ends meet on Social Security and dwindling savings. Some, such as Janek, have told BI they're unable to retire or trying toreenter the job marketto boost their income, while others are scrambling to cut their expenses. With just over $2,000 a month in Social Security income, Janek is unable toafford most essentials, such as groceries and rent, she said. She recently moved from Sonoma County, California — where she lived for 34 years — to Casper, Wyoming. She's living with a friend to save money and applying for jobs, with no luck yet. ""Everything is just climbing so dramatically that I think seniors are going to be in some real trouble in the future,"" she told BI. Janek spent her career in various roles in finance, computer programming, and environmental conservation. She said she felt financially comfortable for most of her life but never made enough money to buy her own home in Sonoma County, where median home prices arenearly twicethenational average— according to the real estate platform Redfin. Janek said that in 2021, she had to retire earlier than she expected and claim Social Security because of ahealth condition. She spent most of the money she saved for retirement on bills and caring for her mother. She said it had beenchallenging to land a new jobat her age. At some companies, she never hears back after submitting her application. At others, she doesn't pass the interview stage. She said she hadn't been able to land afull-time job and is unable to work in retail or the service industry because she can't stand for long periods of time. This past summer, Janek moved to Wyoming in an effort tocut her living costs. She said utilities and gas are cheaper in Casper, and she saves on rent because she's staying with a friend, but there are fewer healthcare options than she had on the West Coast. Janek said she would qualify for somelow-income housing, but she's been on waiting lists in California, Wyoming, and neighboring states for years without a placement. ""It's depressing to realize that there's very few places I can afford to live,"" she said. ""And the few places I could afford to live are not places I really want to live. It's looking like I may have to leave the country."" Moving again could make Janek's life more affordable, but she said it would come at the expense of her community.Relocatinghas already been lonely, she said, and it's been difficult to reestablish care with new doctors and meet new friends. Janek isn't sure what she'll do next, but she said it helps to know that she isn't alone: Many older Americans arestruggling with financesin retirement. ""I think there are a lot of people in my situation,"" she said.",https://www.businessinsider.com/retired-boomer-looks-job-supplement-social-security-moved-california-wyoming-2025-3
You'll soon be able to trade 24 hours a day during the week if Nasdaq gets its way,"Nasdaqannounced Friday that it intends to allow 24-hour trading five days a week to take advantage of investors around the world wanting to trade US markets. The second-largeststock exchangein the country after the New York Stock Exchange is awaiting regulatory approval for the plan, but it hopes this trading option will be available in the second half of 2026. ""We are excited to share that Nasdaq has begun engaging with regulators, market participants and other key stakeholders, with a view of enabling 24-hour trading five days a week on the Nasdaq Stock Market,"" Nasdaq's president Tal Cohen said in a blog post. ""Attracting more investment to our markets presents a compelling opportunity for both the US and global economy,"" he said. ""It is therefore incumbent on us to enhance access for those operating across different time zones. "" Nasdaq's announcement follows the NYSE, which is part of Intercontinental Exchange, saying in October 2024 that it plans to extend weekday trading to 22 hours a day. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved the plans in February, though the NYSE still has other regulatory hurdles to navigate before launching extended trade. Last month, Chicago-based Cboe Global Markets said it also plans to introduce a 24-hour, five-days-a-week schedule for equity trading. ""The question is not whether we can build a market that operates 24/5, but how we do so in a way that strengthens investor confidence in US capital markets today,"" Cohen said. The Nasdaq Composite was down about 2.6% on Thursday to just above 18,000, its lowest since beforePresident Donald Trump's election, and formally in the territory of a market correction.

"She thought she'd won $1.4 million. They tried to pay just $26,000 — but she didn't take no for an answer.","A woman from the UK who was told on agamblinggame that she had won over $1.4 million but was only given $26,000 has won a legal challenge against the betting firm. In October 2020, Corrine Durber placed a bet on the online platform of Irish gambling firm Paddy Power. Thegame, Wild Hatter, was a combination of fruit machine reels and a wheel of fortune, documents from the court case said. Durber, who lives in Gloucestershire in southwest England, said she was playing the game on her iPad when she won ajackpot prizein its first stage and was moved to the next level. Per court documents, she was then asked to spin the jackpot wheel. After clicking the ""spin"" button, Durber was informed she had won the ""Monster Jackpot"" of £1,097,132 ($1,416,000). Instead, she was paid £20,265 ($26,160) by Paddy Power, the amount due if Durber had won the ""Daily Jackpot"" instead. The case, which reached the UK's High Court, said that no explanation was provided for why the sum changed to a much smaller figure. Durber complained to the gambling company on the same evening she won, the case said. At the time, Paddy Power said the computer system that ran the game had made a mistake and displayed an incorrect figure. Paddy Power said she should have won a ""Daily Jackpot,"" but because of the programming issue, the ""Monster System"" segment lit up. Durber sued PPB Entertainment, which trades as Paddy Power and Betfair, for the money she was due under the terms of a consumer contract and breach of contract. In his ruling earlier this week, High Court judge Justice Andrew Ritchie said: ""When a trader puts all the risk on a consumer for its own recklessness, negligence, errors, inadequate digital services and inadequate testing, that appears onerous to me."" Speaking to PA Media after the decision, Durber said: ""As you can imagine, I'm so relieved and happy that the judge has confirmed I fairly and squarely won £1 million from Paddy Power."" ""I will never bet with them ever again,"" she said. Flutter UKI, which owns Paddy Power, told Business Insider in a statement: ""Every week, tens of thousands of customers win with Paddy Power, including an individual who received a £5.7m jackpot just one year ago. ""We always strive to provide the best customer experience possible and pride ourselves on fairness. We deeply regret this unfortunate case and are reviewing the judgment.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/million-dollar-jackpot-gambling-paddy-power-sued-unpaid-prize-money-2025-3
Elon Musk's wealth tanks by $102 billion in 2 months as Tesla stock hits the skids,"Elon Musk's net worth has tumbled by $102 billion this year following a sharp decline in Tesla stock. That figure is about the same as the United Parcel Service's entire market value. TheTeslaandSpaceXCEO's wealth has shrunk by about 24% in under 10 weeks to $330 billion at Thursday's close, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Musk is still comfortably the world's richest person, with a roughly $108 billion lead over second-placeJeff Bezos, despite being the biggest wealth loser this year. He's well ahead ofMichael Dell, whose net worth is down $20 billion. Musk's fortune has been hit by a 35% plunge in Tesla's share price this year, from about $404 to $263. The sell-off has cut its market value by more than $400 billion to under $900 billion. Investors have dumped the automaker's stock for several reasons. Musk spent more than $250 million to helpDonald Trumpget reelected, stumped at the Republican candidate's rallies, and marshaled his X followers to vote for Trump in November's election. The tech billionaire has remained a close advisor since Trump's victory, spearheading efforts to streamline federal spending with his White HouseDOGEoffice. The combination of hisdivisive politics, concerns about his new role distracting from his CEO duties, and reports of Teslasales declinesin several countries have weighed on the company's shares. Several other members of the$100 billion clubhave taken a hit to their fortunes from the recent slump in stocks, which has been fueled by worries that Trump's tariffs and government cuts will cool economic growth or evencause a recession. Oracle'sLarry Ellisonhas had $19 billion wiped off his wealth, reducing it to $173 billion. Similarly, Nvidia's Jensen Huang and Amazon's Bezos have each had about $17 billion erased from their respective net worths this year. Bezos is now tied with Meta founderMark Zuckerbergon $222 billion; Zuckerberg has added $14 billion to his wealth in 2025, while the Amazon founder has shed almost $17 billion.",https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-wealth-tesla-stock-price-trump-billionaires-ev-doge-2025-3
Wall Street titans are racing to build the next Berkshire Hathaway. Emulating Warren Buffett won't be easy.,"Wall Street heavyweights are vying to become the nextWarren Buffett— or at least build their own versions of Berkshire Hathaway. Pulling pages from the Buffett playbook is one thing — having the smarts, patience, and discipline to succeed is another. Thelegendary investorand Berkshire CEO turned a failing textile mill into one of the world's biggest companies in part by acquiring insurers such as GEICO and National Indemnity. Buffett took their ""float,"" or the difference between the premiums they collected and the claims they paid out, and used it to buy stocks and make acquisitions. The strategy spared Buffett and his team from having to raise money from outside investors and then feelingpressure to deliver a returnto them in a few years. Instead, they could bepatient and prudent, only buying when the price was right, and purchasing businesses intending to own them forever — not strip them for parts or flip them for a profit. Berkshire's access to ""permanent capital"" has made it theenvy of the financial world. It's also structured as a vast web of decentralized, autonomous subsidiaries, enabling Buffett to run a company with nearly 400,000 employees while only having a couple dozen staff at its Omaha headquarters. ""We delegate almost to the point of abdication,"" Buffettwrotein his ""Owner's Manual"" for Berkshire shareholders. By trusting day-to-day responsibilities to an army of CEOs, the investor is free to focus on thecritical task of deploying capitalwithin and outside the company. Berkshire's float-fueled model ""enables optimal capital allocation across multiple alternatives — acquiring or reinvesting in majority-owned businesses, public equities, fixed income, share buybacks, and more,"" Larry Cunningham, the director of the University of Delaware's Weinberg Center on Corporate Governance and the author of several books about Buffett and Berkshire, told Business Insider. ""The scope for conferring autonomy, decentralization, and permanence adds more value,"" Cunningham said. ""It does require both intelligence and patience, which are scarce resources."" When KKR co-CEOsJoseph Baeand Scott Nuttall first joined the private equity giant in 1996, Berkshire was worth about $40 billion. ""You fast-forward 28 years, they have atrillion-dollar market capon the back of long-term compounding of their balance sheet and their investments,"" Bae said at the Bloomberg Invest conference in New York on Wednesday. ""Some version of that is what we're going to be doing at Strategic Holdings."" KKR manages about $650 billion of assets in its core business and owns the life insurer Global Atlantic, which has another $190 billion or so of assets under management. Last year, it introduced a third division, Strategic Holdings, which Bae hoped would become ""in some ways amini Berkshire Hathaway."" The new segment owns large stakes in 18 businesses that Bae and his team view as highly defensive with healthy long-term growth potential, and which they expect to own ""literally forever."" KKR plans to invest its free cash flow in more of these kinds of ventures, spanning not just private equity but other sectors and real assets such asinfrastructure, Bae said. Speaking at the same summit on Wednesday, Brookfield CEO Bruce Flatt said his company's insurance business could eventually own its $1 trillion asset management arm and its investment operations, ""which is reallywhat Berkshire Hathaway is."" Flatt added that Brookfield's ""special ingredient"" is its $150 billion of capital that it can use to grow its insurance arm, invest in other divisions, or fundstock buybacksover the next 20 years. ""The attraction to investing inside an insurance company is the zero cost of float. It is effectively a margin account with zero interest,"" Bill Smead, the founder and chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management, told BI. ""These companies are increasingly looking to invest in long-duration, illiquid assets, in things like infrastructure and private credit, where the prices are not printed each day in the newspaper,"" Smead continued, adding that ""long-duration assets are best suited to compound on the balance sheet rather than in a fixed-period fund."" Apollo Global Management's CEO and cofounder,Marc Rowan, has also emulated the ""Oracle of Omaha"" in using insurance to finance investments. ""There are elements of Berkshire Hathaway,"" Rowansaidabout the private equity titan's takeover of Athene, a specialist in annuities and life insurance, in March 2021. Rowan's cofounder,Joshua Harris, said on an earnings call in 2019: ""Next to Berkshire Hathaway, we have the largest amount of permanent capital out there in this business."" Harris also described Apollo as an ""asset-light Berkshire Hathaway"" at a forum in 2020. ""It's not surprising to see others try to emulate Berkshire — after all, Berkshire has proven to those paying attention that these concepts work,"" Adam Mead, the author of ""The Complete Financial History of Berkshire Hathaway,"" told BI. At 94, Buffett isnearing the end of his career, which could leave room for a new generation of permanent-capital allocators. But ""it's one thing to buy forever. It's quite another to buy and leave largely alone like the Berkshire model,"" Mead said. ""I'd be surprised if these 'newcomers' to the Berkshire way of buying for keeps can resist meddling with management or business models,"" he added.

Broadcom just proved Nvidia will be looking over its shoulder for a while longer,"No matter where Nvidia executives go, they get questions about custom AI chips. Broadcom just made sure that's not going to stop anytime soon. Broadcom released quarterly earnings Thursday to a soaring market reaction and glowing reviews — largely thanks to its AI business. Broadcom burstinto the mainstream AI conversation in December when it ballooned into the $1 trillion market cap club for the first time. Like most AI stocks, Broadcom has had a volatile 2025, though the stock jumped more than 10% after hours Thursday after the company reported $4.1 billion in AI revenue in the last quarter — a 77% uptick in revenue compared to the same period last year. Broadcom, led by CEO Hock Tan, is one of the top players in the Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) business. These custom AI chips are generally designed in partnership with cloud companies and aren't as versatile as Nvidia's coveted chips. They're designed to perform specific, high-volume AI tasks at a much lower cost. As AI workloads grow and scale, analysts expect ASICs to be an increasingly attractive option for customers, which, even as they build their custom programs, are often still placing large orders with Nvidia. Morgan Stanley analysts have forecast that the market forASICswill nearly double to $22 billion this year. Broadcom projected its own AI business with its three largest hyperscaler customers would bring in between $60 billion and $90 billion in the next two years. Synovus senior portfolio manager Dan Morgan wrote to investors Thursday that Broadcom is a ""compelling way to play"" in AI investment since it is ""less volatile than the merchantAGIrace."" Analysts say Broadcom's largest customers for AI chips are Google, ByteDance, and Meta. Tan said the company is engaged with an additional four, though he hesitated to call them customers on the call. He highlighted the difference between developing and testing a new chip and ordering it at scale for deployment. Nvidia CEOJensen Huanghad a similar warning in his remarks last week during thecompany's earnings call. ""Just because the chip is designed doesn't mean it gets deployed. And you've seen this over and over again,"" Huang said. When asked about the competitive threat from ASICs, Huang said, ""We're general, we're end-to-end, and we're everywhere."" The story for custom chips isn't quite uniform. Marvell, another prominent player that makes Amazon's custom AI chips, missed expectations in its earnings report Wednesday.",https://www.businessinsider.com/broadcom-q1-2025-earnings-stock-soars-nvidia-competition-grows-2025-3
"Inside 'Project Voyage': Goldman Sachs' grand plan to thin its ranks, cut costs","Goldman Sachs has a grand plan to thin its ranks and cut costs — and it's codenamed ""Project Voyage."" CEO David Solomonhas tasked staff with providing the bank with lists of executives who could help save the company money through layoffs or relocations, Business Insider has learned. The plan, which has been nicknamed ""Project Voyage,"" kicked off in the fourth quarter of 2024 and is expected to be rolled out over a number of years, according to a former Goldman employee, who was not authorized to speak to the press and asked to remain anonymous. The initiative will be rolled out firmwide, affecting divisions including global banking and markets, asset and wealth management, engineering, operations, communications, marketing, and back-office functions, this person said. A Goldman spokeswoman pointed BI to comments Solomon made in January about ""a three-year program"" to better manage the bank's expenses. ""As discussed at length on our fourth-quarter earnings call, we're focused on operating the firm effectively and prudently over the long term, managing our business to meet the needs of our clients and re-investing for growth,"" a Goldman spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. Every year, Goldman Sachs cuts as many as 5% of its bottom performers through a process known internally as the Strategic Resource Assessment, or SRA. Employees who routinely fail to comply with Goldman's five-day-per-week office attendance policy, for example, could be vulnerable to a cut through the SRA —particularly if they're found to be underperforming in their job. This year's SRA, however, will be informed to some degree by ""Project Voyage,"" the ex-Goldman insider said. The bank's vice presidents — a title that sits between associate and managing directors — will be eyed for cuts in part because Project Voyage has identified this group as too large and costly. As BI reported on Wednesday, Goldman's VP ranks have become so bloated that its VPs have been increasingly reporting to other VPs rather than managing directors. Compensation for client-facing VPs can reach $1 million, including base salary and bonuses, the former employee estimated. In addition to thinning out bloated parts of the organizational chart, Project Voyage will pinpoint employees who could help save the company money by relocating from Goldman's New York City headquarters, located in lower Manhattan, tolower-cost offices such as Dallas, Texas; and Salt Lake City, Utah, according to people familiar with the program. The plan also calls for jobs lost through the SRA to be backfilled in lower-cost locations rather than New York, this person said. Goldman divisional heads are compiling their lists of cuts and relocations through their chief operating teams. On Wall Street, divisional COOs tend to oversee the administrative functions for their teams. Goldman's office in Dallas is on track to increase from its current headcount of about 4,600 employees to 5,000 by the time it opens a$500 million state-of-the-art campusin 2028. The city's mayor previously authorized $18 million in tax incentives for the firm if it meets that target. The incentives are valid through the end of 2028.

VC Kelly Barton balances investing with winning IRONMAN world championships. Here's why she says her passion makes her a better investor.,"For CapitalG investor Kelly Barton, being twice as busy as the average person for most of her life — including as a member of the MIT crew team — has paid off in her professional endeavors. Barton is a vice president on CapitalG's investment team, where she focuses on fintech and software startups. Since joining in 2021, she's helped the fund write checks for supply-chain startup Coupa, insure tech startup Duck Creek Technologies, and wealth-management fintech Further. Her fitness journey has also reached new highs: Barton in December traveled to Taupō, New Zealand, to compete in the IRONMAN 70.3 World Championships. She won her age group at the competition and became a world champion IRONMAN for women ages 25-29. While her elite-athlete status makes her especially unique, Barton is one of many venture capitalists around the country who are formercollege athletesand for whom sports still make up a big part of their identity. For Barton, training as an elite triathlete has only improved her investing game — she was promoted at CapitalG in early 2024 in the midst of training for her world-championship qualification. ""One thing that I've appreciated is that workouts create a forced space for me to think about the companies I back,"" she said. ""Stepping back for two-plus hours a day helps me find the space to think about their next steps."" After seven years of rowing, through 2017, Barton was ready for something new. She picked up running after college, trained for a marathon, and then transitioned to triathlons with the goal of one day completing a full IRONMAN — a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride, and 26.2-mile run. Barton, who at the time coached herself, was the overall winner of her first triathlon, an Olympic-distance event consisting of a 1.5-kilometer swim, 40-kilometer ride, and 10-kilometer run. She then finished near the top of her age group in her first half IRONMAN, qualifying for the 70.3 World Championships in 2021. In 2022, she won her age group in every race she competed in. In 2023, she started winning the overall women's field in some of her races and qualified for both the full and half IRONMAN World Championships, earning her professional triathlete license, or ""Pro Card."" While her triathlon career was picking up steam, so was her career in VC. Barton joined CapitalG in August 2021 and was promoted in February 2024 to vice president, leading investments in B2B fintech and vertical software companies. The life of an elite endurance athlete spending tens of hours per week training might seem incompatible with the life of a VC. Barton, who spends more than two hours running, biking, and swimming most days, said her background in sports has made her a better investor because she sees the big picture, rather than fixating on small details like one missed workout or a less-than-stellar conference call. She added that while it might seem counterintuitive, having a busier schedule encourages her to slow down and find balance between her personal and professional lives. ""You can work 24-7 if you want to, and early on I would just train, sleep and work, but I have much better balance now,"" she said. Barton says that she sees investing as a natural extension of her time at MIT, where she was constantly surrounded by peers solving cutting-edge problems in research labs. She was drawn to venture capital for the opportunity to work with founders with a similar mindset. At CapitalG, Barton focuses on growth-stage fintech and software investments. She's particularly interested in massive profit pools within financial services, such as the $100 trillion wealth management industry in the U.S. One of her big bets last year was Farther, a tech-enabled wealth management firm that raised a $72 million Series C co-led by CapitalG and Viewpoint Ventures. Looking ahead to 2025, Barton is excited to continue developing deep investment theses in fintech. One of the biggest questions she's focused on is how digital banking will evolve globally. CapitalG invested in Monzo last year, and Barton is particularly interested in how regional differences affect digital banking adoption. In the U.K., for example, Monzo has built a beloved consumer product, but the tech hasn't taken off in other countries that have different cultures of handling money. Barton is looking for opportunities in other markets, especially where cash payments are still king. ""2025 is going to be about answering big questions on how certain markets and trends will evolve,"" she said. ""I'm excited to spend years thinking about these problems and working with founders to solve them.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/how-ironman-champion-kelly-barton-drives-fintech-investing-at-capitalg-2025-2
We contributed to our kids' Roth IRAs to help them get a financial head start,"When I was a teenager, the last thing on my mind was retirement. If someone had told me toopen an investment accountfor my future, I probably would have laughed and spent my paycheck at the mall instead. Looking back, I wish someone had pulled me aside and explained the power of starting early. Even starting a basic savings account would have been more helpful than spending my money on a stack of Gap sweaters with matching socks. As a parent, I wanted to make sure that my kids, now ages 27, 25, 24, and 22, got a better start to their financial lives. I created a novel way to make sure my own teens don't miss out on one of the easiest and most effective tools to build long-term wealth: theRoth Individual Retirement Account. It's not just about setting them up for retirement — it's about teaching financial habits that will serve them for life. When mychildren started working, all around the ages of 15 or 16, I made them a deal. I would provide logistical support, such as transportation, work clothing or uniforms, and the occasional Slurpee on a hot day. In return, they'd contribute 25% of their earned income to a Roth IRA each year. Then I'd match their contributions 3-to-1, so that essentially, 100% of their earned income would be put into their IRA, up to that year's contribution limit. At first, they were earning well under the contribution limit. As theirincome grew, the math started to shift. Their contribution represented a larger portion of the yearly limit, and our contribution shrunk. For example, in a year with a $6,000 limit, if their 25% was $2,500, then Mom and Dad were only chipping in $3,500. This plan had two primary goals. First, it created ahabit of saving. Second, compounding growth requires time. The earlier you start, the more your money works for you. Why a Roth IRA instead of a savings account? Investing in a Roth IRA at a young age provides a distinct tax advantage that's hard to replicate as you get older. Because most teens don't earn a lot of money, they typically don't have to pay income taxes (in 2025, people who make under $15,000 a year don't have to file a tax return). Opening a Roth IRA for a teen is easier than most people think. Many brokerage firms offer custodial Roth IRAs, meaning a parent manages the account until the child turns 18 or 21 (depending on the state). Once the account is open, they caninvest in something simple, like an S&P 500 Index fund, and watch their money grow over time. A lot of parents assume their kid needs to have a ""real"" job to open a Roth IRA, but that's not true. Any earned income qualifies, whether it's from babysitting, mowing lawns, tutoring, or a part-time job. Just make sure they keep track of that income — and, if it meets the threshold, report it for tax purposes. If any of my children need the money before retirement for a major expense — like buying a first home or even an emergency — Roth IRA contributions can be withdrawn at any time without penalty. It's not just about saving for old age; it's about creating afinancial safety netfor life. That safety net can open up options at many different points during life, including feeling comfortable leaving the workforce to care for children or parents, being able to start a business, or just meeting the demands of the expensive times in life. As parents, we spend so much time worrying about our kids' future — college, careers, relationships. But one of the greatest gifts we can give them is a head start onfinancial independence. Helping your teen open a Roth IRA sets them up for long-term wealth, but it also teaches them valuable habits that will serve them well into adulthood. The process is straightforward, and the benefits are undeniable. By taking this small step today, you're giving your child the freedom and security to make better financial choices in the future.",https://www.businessinsider.com/helped-kids-contribute-maxiumum-roth-iras-2025-3
How Brevan Howard is taking advantage of the crypto vibe shift,"Aron Landy — the CEO of $34 billion macro investment manager Brevan Howard — believes the ""tipping point"" that will lead institutional investors to pile into crypto is on the horizon. Years of volatility and big-name bad actors have kept institutions away from digital assets. Still, with a new administration in the US and asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity becoming more entrenched in the space, the world's biggest investors will slowly wade into the space — and then dive fully in. London-based Brevan Howard, through its $2.5 billion stand-alone crypto unit that was up over 52% last year, is aiming to be the place to go for crypto-curious institutions. ""The predominant mindset in the institutional space has been that any exposure to digital assets is a little too volatile,"" Landy told Business Insider. ""I believe that a shift in mindset is happening and that soon, even this year, having zero exposure to digital assets will be the true risk."" ""At the moment, it's kind of a separate asset class, but over time, there'll be a convergence,"" he added. That convergence may be sped up by President Donald Trump's administration. After years of frustration under former President Joe Biden's SEC commissioner Gary Gensler, President Donald Trump, and his crypto czar David Sacks have provided a jolt to the space. While some have been frustrated with the administration's crypto agenda, including the creation of meme coins related to Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, and the strategic reserve of different digital assets, the election was a positive change for the industry, said Gautam Sharma, the CEO and chief investment officer of Brevan Howard Digital. Sharma declined to provide additional comment on the creation of the reserve. The size of the talent pool and the amount of capital in the US means the ""vibe"" around an industry can matter just as much as a specific policy, Sharma said. Brevan thinks of the industry as a ""transformational technology"" akin to the internet, Landy said, and ""any new innovation needs two things: talent and capital,"" Sharma said. The two executives said there should be plenty of momentum to attract ambitious young people to the industry. ""The digital asset universe has tailwinds, not headwinds,"" Landy said. September will be the unit's fourth anniversary, and Sharma told BI that the goal remains the same as when they launched in 2021. ""Our objective is to be the leading asset manager for institutional investors in digital assets,"" he said, noting that the manager is working on a few additional products for institutional investors to add alongside its flagship multi-manager crypto fund. As the digital asset space becomes more integrated into financial institutions and accepted by regulators, big-name asset managers will follow suit. Former crypto critics,like Citadel Securities' Ken Griffin, are embracing the space and building out their offerings because of the tailwinds. Among alternative investors, especially those catering to large institutional investors like sovereign wealth and pension funds, Brevan has a relative headstart thanks partly to its founder, billionaire Alan Howard. Howard has been interested in the space for close to a decade and started investing his personal capital in 2016 and has seen firsthand how the industry has changed, Sharma said. ""Alan understands this space better than most, not just the investing side of it but the systems,"" said Sharma, who previously ran internal projects for the hedge fund and oversaw the buildout of the digital assets business alongside Natalie Smith, the firm's head of strategy and client partnership group. Howard's enthusiasm led Brevan Howard Digital to focus not just on hiring investing staff, technologists, and engineers. The firm built the unit's infrastructure from scratch over six months in 2021 and now has a team of more than 60 people in eight offices that can trade around the clock. A person close to Brevan said the firm's digital asset investment products have ""relatively long lock-up periods"" to help the firm withstand volatility. It aligns with the firm's belief that small bumps in the road will be just that: bumps in the road. The digital asset industry ""could be worth many multiples than what it is now,"" Landy said, and the firm wants to partner with institutions willing to back that long-term vision. The separate digital-asset unit invests in liquid coins such as Bitcoin but also options, derivatives, and private stakes in startups. Brevan Howard Digital also helps diversity the firm's largest multistrategy funds, managing sleeves of capital for the $12 billion master fund. ""The reason to invest is not because it's going up, or that it's gone down and therefore cheap,"" but instead to be exposed to something transformational for all industries, Landy said. The firm's conviction in the industry comes not just from Howard's personal interest, but the many engineers and technologists inside the firm who have been passionate about the space for years, he said. ""From a macro investing perspective, investors should have some exposure to it,"" he said, and the firm is ready for the ""tipping point"" that will lead to institutions flooding in. ""Having some exposure will be the norm,"" Landy said, and those who choose Brevan ""invest with us because they want our expertise.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/brevan-howard-digital-assets-crypto-investing-investor-pitch-aron-landy-2025-3
Wall Street pay revealed: What investment bankers earned in 2024,"On Wall Street, yourend-of-year paycheckcan often indicate your standing at work. Yet, knowing where your bonus pay ranks compared to peers is not so simple. In an effort to shed some light on Wall Street pay trends, the recruiting firm Prospect Rock Partners surveyed more than 900 investment bankers about their 2024 salaries and bonuses. The survey was conducted between December 1, 2024, and February 28 using Prospect Rock's banking industry contacts. It's the third year Meridith Dennes, the firm's managing partner, has conducted it. ""It's always been so cryptic,"" Dennes told Business Insider about the Wall Street compensation structure. ""The whole point of the survey is that compensation is much more nuanced than what people talk about."" Survey respondents included bankers from all ranks, from analysts up to vice presidents and managing directors, and across a multitude of coverage groups and firms. Prospect Rock Partners gave BI permission to publish select slides fromits full survey. The results shared here suggest that so-called elite boutique banks (think Evercore, Lazard, and Centerview) saw total compensation increases of between 11% to 68% across all roles. Total pay for associates at elite boutiques rose an average of 31% for first-year associates and 33% for second-year associates. Managing director compensation at elite boutiques jumped from about $1 million in 2023 to over $1.7 million in 2024, an increase of 68%. These bonus insights come as Wall Street waits with bated breath to see whether themergers-and-acquisitions reboundmany industry experts predicted for 2025 will fully materialize or fizzle out. ""There's so much uncertainty —geopolitical risk, the impact on the private sector ofDOGE cuts, tariffs, and the interest rate environment — which can cause a lot ofturmoil in the market,"" Dennes said. Theinvestment banking hiring surgethat started at the end of 2024 continues, however, Dennes said. ""I, as a recruiter, am seeing an increase in job requisitions coming in, but it's much harder to find talent than what people want,"" she said. ""More companies who haven't used recruiters in the last two years are coming out of the woodwork now."" This portion of the survey shows the average 2024 compensation for survey respondents at all investment banking levels. The most junior employees — first-year analysts — averaged a base pay of more than $110,000. The data also suggests that most analysts earned a bonus that equaled about 50% of their base pay in 2024. Higher-level bankers — vice presidents and up — generally earned bonuses equal to or higher than their base pay. The biggest gains went to group heads, who are usually managing directors and partners. They saw average bonuses of more than $1.7 million. Bulge-bracket firms are the largest banks, which tend to handle the biggest deals and, therefore, have the largest investment banking teams. These firms tend to include Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Citigroup. Associates are one tier above analysts, the most junior employees, at an investment bank. This chart shows that associate-level survey respondents who work at bulge brackets earned between $176,000 and $221,000 in base pay for 2024. They reported higher bonuses in 2024 than in 2023. Middle-market bankers tend to focus on smaller clients, often those with annual revenue of under $1 billion. This cohort included banks such as William Blair, Piper Sandler, Oppenheimer, and Baird, Dennes said. The average 2024 base pay for associate bankers at these firms was lower than at bulge brackets — but not by very much. The average 2024 bonus for each position was even more for this cohort than for survey respondents who work at bulge brackets. Associate-level bankers who work at ""elite boutiques"" take the cake for the highest average 2024 base pay and bonus, reporting higher numbers than their peers at bulge brackets and middle-market firms. Elite boutiques are considered the top-tier boutique banks that can compete with the big firms. In 2024, Evercore, Centerview, and Lazard snagged top 10 positions on the league tables for both global and US M&A advice, according to the M&A tracker LSEG. Survey respondents from this group work at firms like Evercore, Centerview, Lazard, PJT Partners, and Moelis. These banks tend to focus solely on investment banking versus larger firms, which may have consumer banking and asset management services. Some boutiques also focus on deals within a specific sector, like media, telecom, or healthcare. That means they often have stronger execution abilities, said Dennes, and therefore higher fee income per banker on their leaner teams. ""One of the most significant findings is the clear correlation between increased compensation in 2024 and recovering deal volumes,"" she wrote in an overview section of the survey's findings. ""This recovery appears most pronounced at elite boutiques, where compensation is directly tied to deal performance and revenue generation."" Second-year associates, whose 2024 comp is described in this section of the survey results, are bankers who have been in the field for anywhere from two to five years, depending on whether they started in investment banking as an analyst or were hired out of an MBA program. The largest group of respondents in this group described themselves as M&A generalists. The survey found this cohort averaged $187,000 in base pay and about $134,000 in bonus pay last year. Other well-paid associates in this group worked in business services, restructuring, and DCM. The report also shows how average compensation has changed since 2022. In some cases, it wasn't for the better, like for vice presidents and managing directors. For context, global dealmaking reached more than $3.16 trillion in 2024, up 10% from 2023, but still lower than the 2022 volume of $3.45 trillion, the deals tracker LSEG said.",https://www.businessinsider.com/investment-banker-compensation-salary-bonus-survey-associates-mds-boutiques-2025-3
A mom details how she feeds her family of 4 on $150 a month plus food bank hauls,"Tiffany Bly has no money left after she pays her monthly bills. To feed her family of four, she relies on herlocal food bank. ""It has saved us,"" said Bly, 57, who lives in North Texas with her 22-year-old daughter Caeleigh Hallman, Hallman's husband, and their baby. ""Everything that we're surviving on we've gotten from our food pantry."" Bly and her family are some of the millions of Americans who rely onassistance programsto eat. About one in seven US households — or 47 million people — lived in a food insecure household in 2023, per the latest data available from the national nonprofitFeeding America. The national food insecurity rate that year was up 38% over 2021. Bly's household cobbles together meals through regular food pantry hauls and limitedspending at the grocery store, usually less than $150 a month. Boxes from the food pantry are often filled with the basics — like ground beef, bread, potatoes, canned vegetables, spaghetti sauce, and pasta — but sometimes, Bly gets lucky: the pantry haseggsor fresh fruit. She said there are a lot of families like hers whoare struggling to put food on the table. She told Business Insider about her finances, grocery shopping strategies, and what she picks up at the foodpantry. ""We're a normal family,"" Bly said. ""We work and we still need help, and it's OK to need the help."" Bly earns just under $2,000 monthly at her administrative job, which is supplemented by the few thousand dollars Hallman's husband makes each month. Becausechildcare is expensiveand difficult to access near their rural Texas town, Hallman stays with the baby. Along with monthly trips to the food pantry, Bly and Hallman also visit a smaller pantry at a church each week to fill up on essentials. At the grocery store, Bly said she sticks to items that are less accessible at pantries, like toilet paper or laundry detergent. Her last trip to Walmart — which included deodorant ($8.97), butter ($7.64), and bacon ($7.94) — added up to $56.28. She shops a couple times a month, but limits her spending. She added that her household doesn't waste anything. When the food pantry has produce, they use every item to make meals, snacks, smoothies, and baked goods. Often, Bly and Hallman show off their pantry hauls, cook together, and encourage followers to ""use their resources"" on their sharedTikTok channel, she said. Bly also said her family gets creative to save money: they make their own hair conditioner with coconut oil and use essential oils and vinegar to make cleaning supplies. ""We don't have other financial assistance,"" she said. ""We are doing it on our own."" While Bly's family is low income, they do not receive any forms of government aid because their household earnings are above thefederal poverty line— which is $32,150 for a family of four. When she applied for SNAP benefits, Bly said her income was $11 too high to qualify. Bly's family's household income is alsoslightly too highfor WIC, which is financial aid for women, infants, and children. Food banks and pantries are often theonly source of food assistancefor low-income Americans who are ineligible for SNAP and other safety net programs, like Bly and Hallman. Feeding America reported that one in six US households received charitable food assistance in 2022, the most recently available data. Bly said there are many different reasons that a family may need help affording groceries, either temporarily or long-term. ""It's OK to be scared about how your bills are gonna get paid,"" she said. ""And it's OK to use the resources that are available to you so you don't have to go hungry."" Are you open to sharing how your grocery budget with us?

"Everything we know about how Wall Street is adopting AI, from Goldman Sachs to Blackstone","Welcome to Wall Street's AI era. Banks, hedge funds, asset managers, and private equity firms have been eager to use generative AI to boost productivity and reduce grunt work for workers. Since OpenAI's introduction of ChatGPT, finance firms have moved from pockets of experimentation to scaling these generative AI tools companywide. Such tech advancementshave been met with a mixof enthusiasm and cynicism. Business Insider has been reporting on how some of finance's biggest players are approaching artificial intelligence, from how it might impact jobs and create new ones, to the different ways firms are cutting costs and ramping up efficiencies. Here is what we know about how Wall Street is embracing AI: We identified 17 of the top AI executives and technologists to know at the country's biggest banks. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is a ""tremendous"" user of the bank's generative AI suite. We have the story of how he and other execs use AI at the bank. Dimon also laid out his vision for how America's largest bank will win the AI battle against fintechs through data. Meet the leaders of that mission. Goldman Sachs' chief information officer and head of machine learning quants say we are at an inflection point with AI. Large language models, the form of AI behind ChatGPT, could transform how Wall Street does business. CEO David Solomon has said AI is changing processes like drafting IPO filings and analyst research. Marco Argenti and Dimitris Tsementzis outlined three areas where the bank is experimenting with LLMs. Meanwhile, Chief Data Officer Neema Raphael also outlined the bank's latest generative AI tool taking aim at enterprise search. Morgan Stanley, which partners with OpenAI, promoted wealth tech executive Jeff McMillan to become the bank's first head of firm-wide artificial intelligence in March. He explained how the wealth management arm has been using its new chatbot and hinted at what's next for the firm. McMillan has also outlined his strategy to turn employees' AI ideas into reality. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley's new innovation head told BI how he is looking to replicate the success of the bank's OpenAI partnership with more technology tie-ups. At Citibank, generative AI is poised to change just about every employee's job, co-chief information officer Shadman Zafar told BI. He outlined the bank's AI strategy and his plans to transform the bank with AI. Deutsche Bank is aggressively experimenting with AI capabilities to transform the bank. The bank is on a hiring spree, trying to more than double its AI employee base of around 300, but uncertainty around regulation, talent wars, and the cost of scaling the tech won't make it easy. Take a look at the patents filed by America's biggest banks over the years to see how they've been thinking about innovating through AI. Data from consultancy Evident revealed how banks are using the tech in everything from trading to UX. AI is entering the deal room. Investment bankers at nine top firms predict that AI will trigger a wave of M&A and IPOs. Here are 11 bankers poised to lead the AI revolution for Wall Street. Some of those bankers predict the deals that could drive the ""AI arms race"" in 2025. Top AI executives at hedge funds are tasked with setting their companies' AI agendas and ensuring that research and tech development progress is shared across the firm. These execs aren't always responsible for building the technology. For some, their role is influencing—or advocating for — its use among internal stakeholders, like portfolio managers, business leaders, and fund founders. Bridgewater launched a fund in July driven by AI. The fund's AIA Labs worked to replicate every stage of the investment process with machine learning. The firm's co-chief investment officer and chief scientist outlined the plans of the world's largest hedge fund. Balyasny Asset Management is in the midst of building the AI equivalent of a senior analyst. Charlie Flanagan, the head of applied AI at the $21 billion hedge fund, broke down his plan to amass a collection of bots to automate grunt work for analysts. D.E. Shaw managing director Neil Katz gave BI an inside look at the quant hedge fund's generative AI approach, which is built on three main capabilities. Man Group, the largest publicly listed hedge fund with $161.2 billion in assets under management, launched a new data and machine learning group focused on generative AI in October. Tim Mace, who heads the department, outlined new capabilities his team is developing. Interviews with 11 AI executives, recruiters, vendors, and consultants working on Wall Street revealed the cultural challenges hedge funds might face as they use their deep pockets to lure in AI talent. These leaders can struggle to gain the trust of business leaders and break into investment teams, and AI researchers have struggled with hedge funds' penchant for secrecy. Wall Street is no stranger to managing and analyzing copious amounts of data — but data is only helpful if you can find it. Here's an inside look at Blackstone's approach to enterprise search: DocAI, a generative AI tool that aims to help workers search and summarize more efficiently. Blackstone is also hoping AI will give it a leg up to capture more of the insurance company market. Here's how the firm is giving its insurance clients an edge with revved-up risk management capabilities. Swedish PE giant EQT built an AI engine called Motherbrain that has changed how its investors source deals. ChatGPT enables the investing giant to take the next step with its AI ambitions. As private equity firms turn to AI for a competitive edge, Thomas H. Lee says its engineers are up to 30% more productive with help from AI coding assistants. The multi-billion investment manager VanEck invested in a Toronto-based startup and is onboarding its technology to boost its ETF business. An exec and the fintech's CEO walked us through how AI will change analysts' and salespeople's jobs. Asset manager AllianceBernstein has been building a team focused on AI and data science since 2017. Andrew Chin, AB's head of investment solutions and data science, talked to BI about how the asset manager uses AI to get an edge, save analysts hours of work, and improve risk management. Block, billionaire Jack Dorsey's company behind Square, Afterpay, and Cash App, developed an AI agent that's an expert coder — it can even write code better and faster than some of the company's top engineers. Here's a look inside the initiative and why Block decided to open-source it. In 2023, the neobank Chime built its own private version of ChatGPT to help its engineers launch new products and features faster and more cheaply. The fintech's CTO walked us through his playbook. Wall Streeters, say hello to your new coworker. AI agents are beginning to permeate the labor force as assistants who can help humans with everyday tasks. Here's how banks and startups want to give every employee their own personalized direct report. Banks, hedge funds, and private equity firms are switching into hiring gear thanks, in part, to a seemingly insatiable demand for AI. Five recruiters outline the most in-demand tech roles on Wall Street AI is creating entirely new jobs on Wall Street. Here's one, which has some private equity firms shelling out pay packages of up to $2 million to drum up AI at portfolio companies. For a broader view at salaries, BI collected salary data on 8 Wall Street banks for AI roles across all levels. Data is king for hedge funds, and Wall Street's generative AI era offers new advantages. Here's how much the biggest proprietary trading firms and hedge funds are willing to pay for talent, according to government data. Top tech execs from Citadel, Goldman Sachs, and AllianceBernstein open up about how AI is changing the role of the CTO on Wall Street. Blackstone recently hired an AI exec from Walmart to apply the technology at its some 230 portfolio companies. AI is redefining what it takes to be a software engineer on Wall Street. Top tech execs from Goldman Sachs and Citi open up about why they want their developers to have liberal arts degrees. Balyasny's Bridger program, designed for incoming sell-side analysts to learn coding and AI skills, highlights the evolving skills of an analyst in the age of AI. Business Insider spoke to five industry experts to get their take on how ChatGPT and its underlying tech could be applied to various sectors of financial services. AI could improve the lives of investment bankers by taking on some tedious tasks, but it can also make it harder to break into and alter the skills required for entry. Generative AI has become a key part of Amazon Web Services's playbook for winning more of Wall Street. The head of the financial services market development walked us through how Amazon's cloud division is working with JPMorgan, Bridgewater, MUFG, and Rocket Mortgage. Quant hedge funds are beginning to rely on the latest AI chips, like Nvidia's popular GPUs, to test some of their most advanced models. Google Cloud is helping quantitative investment firms like Two Sigma and Hudson River Trading innovate around a shortage of sought-after Nvidia AI chips. Auquan only launched less than two years ago, but it's already been signed by some big financial firms. Here's a look at how its technology is automating research work usually done by analysts. This startup wants to transform how investors and traders analyze data with generative AI. And it's catching the attention, and dollars, of some of the biggest names in the hedge fund world, like Millennium Management's founder Izzy Englander and billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller. Meet Mako AI, a generative AI bot designed to solve the woes of early-career private equity associates. The startup, which launched in September, is cofounded by a former Bain and Co. consultant who worked in the PE industry and remembers the countless hours he spent on mundane tasks like collecting data, writing reports, and building formulas. Wall Street firms know the pains of having to satisfy regulators, but advancements in AI are introducing a whole new level of scrutiny and complexity. Meet this startup, which automates some of the most time-intensive parts of the risk management process. Louisa AI is a startup built to suggest potential deals for investment bankers and venture capital investors. The fintech, which was born inside Goldman Sachs by a former Goldman managing director, has suggested $800 million in deal values per quarter across a handful of clients. Wall Street has a reputation for a hard-charging work culture, something that every junior banker learns in their life. Gabe Stengel was one such banker, sometimes staying up until 5 a.m. to create earnings summaries or to pull together presentations for superiors while at Lazard. Stengel knew there had to be a better way.",https://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-goldman-jpmorgan-bridgewater-using-ai-2023-12
"A once-hot startup got a $1.5 billion loan. More than $500 million went to a high school dropout's 'sham' hedge fund, judge rules.","Call it the case of the vanishing half a billion dollars. During the pandemic-era startup funding boom, the education technology company Byju's raised money from some of the biggest names in global investing. At its peak, the Bengaluru-based company was valued at $22 billion, making it the most valuable startup in India. But last week, a US judge ruled thatentities associated with Byju's had fraudulently transferred over $500 million to a group the judge deemed a ""sham."" The summary judgment in Delaware bankruptcy court, released on Thursday, advances the lenders' yearslong search for the missing money. Judge John T. Dorsey ruled against Riju Ravindran — a former Byju's board member and the founder's brother — and entities related to the company, including a hedge fund founded by a 23-year-old high school dropout. Dorsey found the $533 million was fraudulently transferred to what he called a ""high-risk and unproven hedge fund."" It had few other investors, a high fee structure, and, at one point, a Miami IHOP headquarters address with a non-working phone, per court documents. The ruling opens the door for damages — with a hearing about specifics still to be scheduled — and for the lenders to try to recover some of that money. In November 2021, after equity fundraising from BlackRock, the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, and other power players, Byju's set up a special financing vehicle with $1.2 billion from top private lenders, including Ares Management and HPS Investment Partners. Led by the media-hungry founder Byju Raveendran, Byju's expanded quickly by snapping up other companies. Months after the lenders' money came in and without their knowledge, Ravindran transferred $533 million to a tiny hedge fund called Camshaft Capital, per Thursday's summary judgement. The fund was run by a portfolio manager named William Morton, who the lenders said in a complaint had no investment experience. The lenders' complaint said last year that Morton had recently bought three luxury cars: a 2023 Ferrari Roma, a 2020 Lamborghini Huracán EVO, and a 2014 Rolls-Royce Wraith. Ravindran's attorneys told the Delaware bankruptcy court that he moved the money to Camshaft because ""Byju's felt the need to protect the cash."" Ravindran said in sworn testimony that he had never heard of Camshaft before April 2022 and that he did no diligence prior to the transfers. Dorsey wrote in the summary judgment that Camshaft should have spotted ""numerous red flags"" pointing to the transactions' ""fraudulent purpose."" Camshaft then lent the money to a British company in a deal done without the lenders' approval, wrote Dorsey. The lenders have yet to trace the money, despite extensive efforts detailed in court documents. Last week's lawsuit is just one part of Byju's winding saga, which stretches across continents and involves more than a dozen lawsuits. While the level of funding Byju's commanded during its heyday sets it apart from the ed-tech competition, the company is part of a wave of global startups that picked up significant funding during the pandemic. At the time, investors scrambled to back companies amid record low interest rates. Now, lower valuations in a much different market threaten those good-times investments. After negotiations with Byju's fell apart over missed interest payments and other issues, the lenders put the special financing vehicle through involuntary bankruptcy. They appointed Timothy Pohl, a restructuring veteran, to manage the company and unravel the key mystery: the money's trail. But even after Pohl took over as the sole manager in March 2023, Ravindran continued to move money out, Dorsey wrote in Thursday's summary judgement. In May 2023, Raveendran told an advisor to the lenders that the money had gone ""someplace the Lenders will never find it,"" the advisor later wrote in a declaration. So far, legal proceedings have offered few clues about the missing $533 million. Morton and his fund were held in contempt of court last year for failure to cooperate with discovery. He toldThe Wall Street Journallast spring that he had fled the US with no plans to return — and that Camshaft is not a sham. Raveendran and Ravindran are last known to be living in Dubai. Ravindran was also held in contempt of court last year. The lenders said in a statement on Friday that they see the ruling as a ""significant step forward"" in their recovery efforts. ""We are gratified the Court unequivocally recognized that Riju Ravindran, Camshaft, and BYJU's together conducted a deliberate fraud on a global scale arising from the theft of $533 million,"" the lenders said in the statement. Byju's is still operating, but the company faces significant turmoil beyond the US bankruptcy case. BlackRock and at least one other equity investor havewritten off the value of their investments. BlackRock and the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative did not respond to Business Insider's requests for comment, nor did Byju's. Lawyers for Morton and Ravindran did not respond to requests for comment, nor did Morton or Raveendran. Ravindran could not be located for comment. Raveendran wrote on LinkedIn on Friday and again on Monday that he would rebuild the company. ""I will keep on keeping on. Till the wrongs are righted, and the mistakes are corrected,"" he posted on Monday. Have a tip? Contact this reporter via email atmmorris@businessinsider.comor Signal or Telegram at +1 646 768 1627.

Are you worth $10 million? $100 million? Chances are you live in the US.,"More of the superrich live in the US than in any other country. According to the 2025 Wealth Report by Knight Frank, a London-headquartered global real estate consultancy, 39% of the world's individuals with net worths of $10 million or higher are based in the US. In total, 905,413 such individuals live in the US. This is almost twice the number inChina, which has 471,634. There are 122,119 people worth over $10 million living in Japan. The fourth highest on the list is India, with 85,698. ""Despite our forecast that Asia will outpace North America in wealth creation over the next four years, there is no realistic challenge to US dominance,"" authors of the paper said. In the bracket of people worth $100 million and over, more than 40% live in the US. ""While the global economy slowed through 2024, the resilience of the US helped prop up investor confidence,"" Liam Bailey, global head of research at Knight Frank, said. ""The trends powering wealth creation, including growth in financial markets led by equity markets and thebitcoinrun, continued through 2024. And despite geopolitical tensions, resilient global trade further contributed to growth,"" he added. Patrick Gower, a researcher at Knight Frank, said a good year for the rich came from a combination of factors, including big bets on risk assets like cryptocurrencies, theS&P 500rising over 20% for the second year in a row, bitcoin soaring 120%, andPresident Donald Trump's pledge to loosen regulatory standards. The US also dominated for its billionaire population, containing 30% of global billionaires and 40% of overall billionaire wealth, Knight Frank said. $5.7 trillion of billionaire wealth, a 10-year high, is held in the US, the report said. China, by contrast, has seen a 10% decline in its share of billionaire wealth. In terms of the professions where billionaires are created, finance and investment lead for the overall number ofbillionaires, but tech leads in relation to total wealth. On Bloomberg's widely watched Billionaires Index, eight of the world's 10 richest people — such asElon Musk, Amazon founderJeff Bezos, and Meta'sMark Zuckerberg— made their fortunes through tech. The average age of a billionaire was 65.7 in 2024, Knight Frank's report said. 87% of billionaires are male. However, last year, 82% of new billionaires were men, down from 90% four years ago. Almost half of the billionaires under 30 were women in 2024.",https://www.businessinsider.com/america-billionaires-super-rich-knight-frank-millionaires-2025-3
Millennials are finally buying homes. It may not pay off for them in the long run.,"Young Americans are finally buying homes. It may not pay off for them in the long run. Stop me if you've heard this before: Millennials have gotten screwed by the housing market. The lack of affordable homes is one of the biggest reasons for the generation's economic shortcomings — why they can'tcatch up to their parentsfinancially,live in citiesnear their friends, or even have as many kids as they want to. Several suspects have been blamed for this, includinghouse-hoarding baby boomersandgreedy corporate landlords. But the main issue was timing: A huge number of millennials reached their prime homebuying years after the 2008 financial crisis, right as the housing-market bust was pushing builders to cut back on construction. When it came time for millennials to claim their share of the American dream, the homes simply weren't there. While the country'shousing shortage, now measured in the millions of units, seems intractable, there are growing signs that it may not be a permanent state of affairs. Sure, lots of people have struggled to become homeowners over the past few years, sendingprices to record highsand deepening the housing crunch. But population forecasts for the coming decade suggest a monumental shift is on the horizon. And millennials, after finally lifting themselves onto the homeownership ladder, may wind up with the short end of the stick yet again. There's no denying that Americans are getting older.Slower population growthover the next decade and beyond, with more deaths and fewer births, will mean weaker demand for housing. This slowdown could come to a head in the 2030s, when members of Gen Z — a slightly smaller cohort than millennials — take over as the primary contingent of first-time homebuyers.Baby boomerswill simultaneously be aging out of the market (economist-speak for dying), freeing up millions of homes nationwide. Unless immigration picks up dramatically to compensate, the combination of more supply and less demand could cause home prices to flatline or even drop. Don't get me wrong: Cheaper housing is a good thing. But while a dip in home prices probably sounds like a godsend to the millions of renters hoping to become owners, it could be devastating for those who bought a place in the past few years. These homeowners, mostly millennials, are counting on their properties to grow in value and deliver a hefty financial return — thegilded path enjoyed by baby boomers. Like generations before them, millennials have tied up most of their wealth in their homes, which they'll rely upon to fuel their retirements or fund the purchases of bigger places down the line. Instead, when it finally comes time for them to sell, they may find that their nest eggs have turned out a lot smaller than they'd hoped. Population trends, unlike the constant ups and downs of the economy, follow a steady drumbeat: People grow up, settle down, and eventually die. Demographics can't tell us exactly how many homes we'll need in a decade or two, but they can offer a pretty good idea. Builders and policymakers, however, haven't been great at reading the tea leaves. A recentpaperfrom a team of researchers led by Dowell Myers, a demographer at the University of Southern California, argues that the lever pullers who control the housing supply have been out of touch for decades, relying on old data or focusing too much on the short term at the expense of the more distant future. Take the current housing crunch. For years, demographic forecasts made it clear that a huge chunk of millennials would be looking to settle down in the late 2010s, signaling a need for a lot more houses. But homebuilding activity in 2011 dropped to its lowest level in 60 years, and credit availability tightened, making it harder to get a mortgage and creating more pent-up homebuying demand. Cuetough times for millennials. But some real estate experts are starting to pay more attention to the underlying realities. I recently had lunch with Nik Shah, the CEO of Home.LLC, a housing analytics, consulting, and AI conglomerate. Shah and his team have gained prominence over the past few years for accurately predicting changes in home prices despite a tumultuous market. I was surprised, then, when instead of talking about the coming months, he mostly wanted to discuss the long term. Shah told me he's bullish on home prices for the next handful of years, forecasting mild year-over-year increases. But based on the demographic data, Shah expects home prices to stall out in the 2030s. ""Demographics play a critical role in home prices,"" Shah says. ""And right now, the future projections on demographics are not rosy."" The biggest factor is deaths. In the coming decade, baby boomers will begin ""aging out of the market"" in droves. The size of the generation's adult population is second only to millennials, with roughly 66 million members who range in age from 61 to 79. But their numbers are projected to shrink by about 23%, or 15.6 million people, in the next decade, and by another 23.4 million people from 2035 to 2045.Boomers own about 41% of real estatenationwide, worth roughly $20 trillion, per the Federal Reserve. Their exodus will represent a sea change in the housing market. All those boomer deaths, combined with a slight decline in birth rates over the next two decades, will work out to slower population growth. The result will be a lot less demand for homes. Data from the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies indicates that the total number of households in the US is expected to increase by 8.6 million over the next 10 years. In the past three decades, that figure ranged from 10.1 million households, in the 2010s, to 13.5 million, in the 1990s. From 2035 to 2045, household growth is expected to retreat even more, to a net increase of just 5.1 million, which would be the lowest growth rate in a century. With more deaths and fewer births, the total number of US-born people in the country will shrink. The trajectory of the country's population, Daniel McCue, a senior research associate at the center, wrote in a report, will therefore be ""entirely dependent on future immigration."" Those household-growth projections from the Census Bureau assume that net immigration holds steady at 873,000 people a year for the next decade, roughly in line with the past 30 years. But even if you assume significantly higher immigration, McCue tells me, household growth is expected to decline over time. The next generation of new homeowners won't represent a steep dropoff in demand. Harvard JCHS estimates there are now roughly 68 million Gen Zers, aged 16 to 30, compared to 68.8 million millennials. McCue says the real problem comes from the other end of the population equation, since a steady handoff toGen Z homebuyerswon't offset the wave of boomers exiting the housing market. ""It's not going to be enough to keep up with the pickup in losses, because the baby boomer generation is just so much bigger than previous generations,"" McCue tells me. ""The pickup in mortality is going to outpace that."" Given the shifting demographics, the center says America probably needs to build about 11.3 million homes over the next decade and just 8 million new units between 2035 and 2045 to keep up with demand from new households (not factoring in the current shortage). These are fairly modest goals — in the 2010s, which included the weakest years for new construction in more than half a century, builders still finished almost 10 million units. In the 2000s, they built 17 million. As demand for homes slows down, McCue says, construction should have a chance to catch up. That possibility should sound tantalizing to anyone hoping for an end to our housing shortage. But the imbalance between supply and demand has fueled an extraordinary run-up in home values — if that lopsidedness goes away, millennial homeowners may not see the same financial windfalls as their predecessors. Millennials aren't young upstartsanymore. In 2030, they'll range in age from 34 to 49, according to Pew Research's cutoffs, which means many will be looking to move up the rungs of the housing ladder as they buy their first places or upgrade to bigger homes. They've already made up considerable ground in this department, with more than half the generation now owning their homes. For these fortunate millennials, the past few years of home-price gains have padded their net worths and contributed to a sunnier financial outlook. While things are looking up, that may not last. A slowdown in home-price growth, or even outright declines, could leave a large chunk of millennials in a weird spot. Sure, for those who don't yet own a home, a breather in home-price appreciation could offer a chance to play catch-up. But among the millennials who are actuallydoing pretty well financially, most wealth is tied up in real estate and retirement accounts. An analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis suggests that from 2019 to 2022, the typical person born in the 1980s, otherwise known as an elder millennial, saw the value of their assets balloon by a whopping 57.3%, even after adjusting for inflation. Most of that increase — 41 percentage points — came from real estate. So let's say household formation slows down as expected, relieving some of the pressure on home prices to keep going up, up, up. The team at Home.LLC projects that in this scenario, even if immigration holds steady, home prices will stay flat, maybe increasing by about 1% in some years and dipping slightly in others. That's a long way from the kind of market crash we saw in 2008, but it would mean far less wealth gains for today's millennial homeowners. To illustrate this tension, compare a hypothetical baby boomer with a hypothetical millennial. Each buys a $300,000 home during their heyday. The boomer bought the house in 1994. Thirty years later, it's fully paid off and sells for about $1.21 million — a stunning gain of 305%, based on the typical home-price appreciation in the US over those decades. The millennial buys the house in 2010 and also holds on to it for 30 years. Its value grows by 2.5% each year from 2025 to 2030 and by just 0.5% a year from 2031 to 2040. The home ends up being worth about $813,000, a 171% increase. That's nothing to sneeze at, but you'd take the boomer's gains any day of the week. ""Obviously, the difference is pretty huge,"" Sid Samant, Home.LLC's lead economist, tells me. But even the elder millennial in this example is lucky, because they got to ride out thehistoric home-value increasesfrom the the pandemic. In Home.LLC's model, someone who bought a house in 2022 — say, a millennial who finally found their foothold in the housing market — would see their home's value increase by just 31% through 2040. Forecasting home prices a decade from now is a fraught endeavor. Nobody expectedbaby boomers to stay in their homesas long as they have, throwing the housing market out of whack for everyone else. For policymakers, immigration is the easiest lever to pull in counteracting demographic realities, which also makes it the biggest question mark. And there's no way of knowing how future changes in the economy will alter construction activity or the homebuying calculus. But demographic change is inevitable. And even McCue, the Harvard researcher who lives and breathes this stuff, is still wrestling with the downstream effects of our aging population. ""The extent to which we're going to start losing households was very eye-opening,"" McCue tells me. ""I think we still need to get our heads around the implications of that."" If the housing shortage does indeed go away, it will hardly be mourned. But any big shift usually comes with some collateral damage. In this case, it could be homeowning millennials who get burned.

Goldman Sachs' annual culling of underperformers is coming earlier than usual this year,"Goldman Sachs is moving its annual headcount-cutting ritual from fall to spring this year and will be zooming in on a key constituency for trims: its cohort of vice presidents. The cuts are part of what is known inside Goldman as the annualStrategic Resource Assessment, or SRA, a process the bank has used to cull underperformers that has taken place in the fall in recent years. ""Like other banks, this is part of our normal, annual talent management process,"" a spokesperson for the bank said in a statement. ""We don't comment on the specifics in any given year."" A key target of this year's cuts will be vice presidents, according to a recently departed Goldman employee who requested anonymity to freely discuss company matters. VPs are a rank of executives who sit above associates and below managing directors. This person said executives at the bank had discussed either trimming or transferring some of the bank's VPs to other offices to save money as recently as the fourth quarter, adding that the VP population at Goldman had become so bloated in recent years that VPs were increasingly reporting to other VPs instead of managing directors. The spring timetable and focus on vice presidents was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. In a January call with investors, CEO David Solomon addressed plans to cut costs over the next three years. ""Operating efficiency remains one of our key strategic objectives,"" he said. ""We have established a three-year program as a part of our business planning process that will help us dynamically manage our expense base, harness technology and automation and reinvest in our businesses."" Solomon also said in the January earnings call that the firm is ""optimizing our organizational footprint by expanding our presence in strategic locations."" One of those experiencing the most growth is thecompany's site in Dallas, Texas— which is on track to increase from its current headcount of about 4,600 employees to 5,000 by the time it opens a$500 million state-of-the-art campusin 2028. Every year, Goldman looks for ways to reduce its bottom performers through the SRA. As BI previously reported, Goldman has, in years past, used the benchmark of roughly 5% of staff as a target. While Goldman hasn't disclosed a goal for this year's SRA, WSJ said Goldman is eyeing a trim of between 3% to 5% of staff this year. As of its latest tally, the firm ended 2024 with about 46,500 employees. Cuts of 3% to 5% would suggest layoffs of between 1,395 and 2,325 positions. Goldman's 360-degree annual performance review plays a role in job cuts: Employees are rated by peers and managers on factors like risk management and teamwork, BI has previously reported. The bottom 10% of performers are typically the most vulnerable to being cut. Employees described the review process as stressful and time-intensive, requiring them to solicit feedback and complete evaluations outside work hours.

Aberdeen restores the E's after admitting 'abrdn' rebrand wasn't that clvr,"From Flickr to Grindr and Tumblr to The Weeknd, dropping an E has long been a way tosignal youth and energy. But a 200-year-old investment firm that jumped onthe trend has reclaimed its vowels after facing widespread mockery for joining the E-free club. Standard Life Aberdeen rebranded as ""abrdn"" in 2021 under CEO Stephen Bird, saying it was part and parcel of being ""a modern, agile, digitally-enabledbrand."" The decision sparked cackles at a straight-laced financial group seemingly trying to be cool and hip. Nearly four years later, it hasrebrandedonce again as ""aberdeen,"" reinstating its three E's but stopping short of embracing a capital letter. CEO Jason Windsor wrote in the company's annual report on Tuesday that the move was aimed at ""removing distractions"" and described it as a ""pragmatic decision marking a new phase for the organisation."" The group's chief investment officer, Peter Branner, bemoaned the criticism of its shortened name as ""corporate bullying"" in an interview with Financial News last year. He derided the ""childish jokes"" and questioned whether those poking fun would do the same to a person. The asset manager reported a 6% fall in adjusted net operating revenue last year, to the sterling equivalent of $1.68 billion. Adjusted operating profit rose by 2% as Aberdeen reduced its adjusted operating costs by 7%. The company's stock price jumped by 9% in London on the news, taking its year-to-date gain to about 26%. It still trades about a third lower than it did when it last changed its name. Manycorporations have changed their namesover the years, often to herald a new strategic direction. For example, Weight Watchers rebranded in 2019 as WW after more than 50 years in business, and Dunkin' Donuts became simply Dunkin' the same year. Back in 2002, PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting rebranded as Monday, but it was acquired by IBM shortly afterward.",https://www.businessinsider.com/abrdn-aberdeen-corporate-rebranding-joke-name-vowels-asset-manager-2025-3
Balyasny is closing its Madrid office after cutting its only portfolio manager based there,"Balyasny, the $23 billion hedge fund, is getting out of Spain.

'Bond King' Bill Gross says he's scared to wake up and check the news each morning. He shares 4 stock picks with BI.,"Bill Gross says there'sso much bad news right nowthat he's scared to wake up each day and find out what's happening in financial markets and the world. ""Frankly I am frightened every morning to wake up at 5:30 PST and see what the day brings — markets and otherwise,"" Gross wrote in an X post on Monday. ""Be defensive."" The billionaire investor is known as the ""Bond King"" because he cofounded the fixed-income titan PIMCO and grew its flagship Total Return Fund to $270 billion over nearly three decades. Gross told Business Insider he's concerned about the USeconomy slowingas ""destructive"" tariffs fuel inflation and worried that Ukraine's war with Russia threatens to divide Western nations. ""As an investor these factors scare me at 5:30 and throughout the day,"" Gross said in an email. ""They present downside risks for high p/e stocks especially,"" he added, referring to price-to-earnings ratio, a popular valuation metric. Economists havepared their US growth forecastsin recent days, citing a combination of President Donald Trump'snew tariffson imports from countries including Canada, Mexico, and China, and his administration's effort to cut government spending, which isbeing ledby Tesla CEOElon Musk. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model forecasts an annualized 2.8% contraction this quarter — a dramatic swing from last week when it estimated 2.3% growth. Headline inflation has climbed from 2.4% in September to 3% in January, significantly higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Economists have warned that businesses will offset tariffs byraising their prices, fueling more inflation. Gross told BI that investors should bet on defensive stocks to ride out theeconomic storm. The octogenarian recommended tobacco stocks, specifically Altria, the owner of Philip Morris, British American Tobacco, which owns cigarette brands Lucky Strike and Camel. He also gave the thumbs up to AT&T and Verizon, two of the largest US telecom companies. Tobacco and telecom stocks are seen as defensive picks because they offer little growth but sell sticky products that customers are likely to keep buying even in a recession, trade at relatively modest valuations, and pay large dividends, providing support for their stock prices. Altria stock has jumped 43% over the past year and offers a 7.1% dividend yield. BAT has gained 35% over the same period and has a 7.4% yield. AT&T is up 61% and has a 4% yield, while Verizon has climbed 10% and has a 6.2% yield.",https://www.businessinsider.com/bond-king-bill-gross-tariffs-economy-growth-inflation-stock-picks-2025-3

"Warren Buffett says tariffs are 'an act of war, to some degree'","Warren Buffett is one of the world's most famous investors who turned afailing textile mill into a $1 trillion company.

""Over time, they are a tax on goods. I mean, the Tooth Fairy doesn't pay 'em!"" he said in aninterviewwith ""CBS News Sunday Morning"" when asked how tariffs would impact inflation. ""And then what? You always have to ask that question in economics. You always say, 'And then what?'"" When asked about the current economy, Buffett said: ""Well, I think that's the most interesting subject in the world, but I won't talk, I can't talk about it, though. I really can't."" He also didn't answer further questions about the political environment. The 94-year-old, known as the Oracle of Omaha,hassaid he's staying out of politicsand holding his tongue on divisive topics because speaking out could spark public backlash against Berkshire, potentially harming shareholders and forcing the company's subsidiaries to lay off workers. ""So, I've decidedly backed off — I don't want tosay anythingthat'll get attributed, basically, to Berkshire, and have somebody else bear the consequences of what I talk about,"" Buffett said at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in 2022. Thelover of American stockslike Apple and Coca-Cola told CBS that ""a majority of any money I manage will always be in the United States"" because ""it's the best place."" Since taking office, President Donald Trump has announced or threatened tariffs against several countries.Economists have warnedthat the US imposing tariffs would likely hurt the domestic economy and that additional costs would likely be passed on to the American consumer rather than to foreign exporters. Trump proposed 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada that were initially supposed to take effect in February but were postponed. They are now expected to start Tuesday, though Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnicksaidthey may not be at a 25% rate. After placing a 10% tariff on goods from China last month, Trump announced on Thursday he'd impose another 10% tariff on the country, saying it hasn't done enough to stop fentanyl from entering the US. Trump also announced a 25% tariff onall steel and aluminum importsto the US, which is set to take effect on March 12. He said last month thathe'd charge ""a reciprocal tariff""on countries that have such taxes on American goods. He's also threatened to impose a 25% tariff on European Union countries and said he'd slap a 100% tariff on BRICS nations if they replaced the US dollar as their reserve currency. Buffett has supported presidential candidates in the past, including backing Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, but hedeclined to make an endorsementin the 2024 election.

Ex-Elliott portfolio manager Mark Wills launched a commingled fund — something new hedge funds have been struggling to do,"The Elliott Management spinout Cisu Capital has started trading in its first commingled fund, seven months after it began managing money for a single outside investor. Cisu, run by the former Elliott portfolio manager Mark Wills, began trading with capital from the hedge fund Squarepoint in August, running $200 million in a separate account. Its commingled fund raised more than $100 million, two people familiar with the firm told Business Insider, with a large endowment among the new investor base. Cisu, based in London, declined to comment. Wills spent more than a decade at the billionaire Paul Singer's firm, with a stop at King Street Capital before that. His new firm, which focuses on the financial services sector, has been able to do what many new launches have struggled to do: raise a commingled fund. Commingled funds have large pools of investors and are what investors have typically signed on to when investing into a hedge fund, while separately managed accounts, or SMAs, offer a tailored investment strategy. This often allows LPs to customize risk limits, liquidity terms, and fees. A ripple effect of thegrowth of big-name platformssuch as Millennium has been an increase in the number of new managers being launched via SMAs. Large allocators often prefer SMAs because they give them more transparency on a manager's holdings and they can negotiate onfees. A recent Goldman Sachs report noted that capital in SMAs grew by 27% year over year, with nearly one out of every five allocators using the structure. Allocators are using young managers' lack of scale to their advantage, pushing for new launches and emerging funds to adopt the structure if they want capital. The Goldman report said more than half of the capital in firms with less than $500 million in assets was held in SMAs, up from 41% at the end of 2020.

Trump wants America to stockpile crypto in a strategic reserve. Here's how that could work.,"President Donald Trump'splan to establish a US strategic cryptocurrency reservehas sparked fresh buzz around digital assets. Trump posted Sunday that the reserve, which he said would turn America into the ""Crypto Capital of the World,"" would include five of the 10 most popular cryptos by market value — bitcoin, ether, XRP (Ripple), Solana, and Cardano. The idea means the federal government would hold a certain amount of tokens, similar to thegold it keeps at Fort Knox. Investors seem to like the idea: the coins surged after the announcement. But crypto is different to the assets countries usually stockpile, such as the US petroleum reserve, Canada's maple syrup reserve, and China's pork reserve. Here's what Trump has — and hasn't — said about the plan, and how it could work. Trump has beenfar more friendly to cryptothan past presidents. He and his wifelaunched their own meme coins, $Trump and $Melania, days before he took office in January. Shortly after his inauguration, Trump signed an executive order establishing a ""president's working group on digital asset markets"" that would evaluate the creation of a digital asset stockpile, perhaps using crypto seized from criminals. Trump has also appointedDavid Sacks— a venture capitalist, ""All In"" podcast cohost, and former PayPal operating chief — as the White House AI and crypto czar. Moreover, the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped its enforcement case againstCoinbaselast month. It had accused the largest US crypto exchange of acting as an unregistered securities broker. Taken together, those actions signal the Trump administration wants to nurture the crypto industry and make America a leader in the space. Trump has argued a reserve would help the US dominate the global crypto market and be a global leader in financial innovations such as blockchain. The reserve could also serve as a hedge against inflation, assuming coins maintain their value better than the dollar as prices rise. Embracing crypto could also upgrade the conventional financial system and make international transactions more efficient, and the reserve could hypothetically be used to influence prices during crises. Trump's plan for a reserve has ""fired the starting gun on the crypto arms race"" as other countries will feel pressure to emulate the US, legitimizing tokens and pushing prices higher, Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, said in a morning note. He called it ""nothing short of a financial revolution"" and said it could mean the era of ""uncertainty, regulatory ambiguity and institutional hesitance"" might be over. ""The formal recognition of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as part of a national reserve is a defining moment,"" he said, adding, ""We expect this move to accelerate mainstream adoption, attracting new investors and reinforcing bitcoin's role as a store of value."" Trump didn't specify why he selected bitcoin, ether, XRP, sol, and ada, but each token has its particular uses. Bitcoin is the most popular crypto with a $1.8 trillion market value, representing about 60% of the $3.1 trillion crypto market, per CoinMarketCap. Fans have dubbed it ""digital gold"" as they view it as a reliable store of value given its fixed supply. Ether is the no.2 crypto with a $280 billion market cap and is prized for its ability to underpin smart contracts and enable decentralized finance. XRP ranks third on the list with a $150 billion market value and specializes in enabling rapid, low-cost, cross-border payments. Solana places sixth in market value at $85 billion and is known for being scalable and having low transaction costs. Cardano sits in eighth place at $34 billion, and its blockchain focuses on scalability and sustainability. Trump and his team have not yet given specifics about the scale of the reserve, how it would be funded, and when it might be launched. It could gather crypto assets seized by law enforcement, or the Treasury might purchase crypto on the open market using Federal Reserve profits and its gold stockpile. It might be managed by the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund, or by a dedicated subdivision. The tokens might be placed in cold storage to prevent cyberattacks, or protected in other ways. Trump and Sacks could lay out how the US will buy crypto, how much it will purchase, and its intentions at the White House Crypto Summit scheduled for Friday. ""There are potentially major implications here for the global financial architecture alongside 'Buy all the things!' memetastic trading opportunities,"" Michael Every, global strategist at Rabobank, said in a research note. There are several question marks around the value of a strategic crypto reserve. Crypto tokens are notoriously volatile, which could make them unreliable as strategic assets. Industry regulations may have to be formalized before the US government can hold and wield various coins at scale. Some tokens have close affiliations, such as XRP with Ripple Labs, potentially undermining claims of decentralization. ""Ironically, a currency that was designed to be isolated from government interference and decentralized is now reliant on the US government for its fortunes,"" Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said about bitcoin in a morning note. There are also security risks, as crypto wallets have repeatedly proven vulnerable to thefts and hacks. Skeptics have asked why the US is embracing alternatives to the dollar when the greenback's status as the world's reserve currency is already under threat. High-profile critics, includingWarren Buffett,have dismissed crypto as a tool for criminals who value anonymous and often hard-to-track transactions. They've alsomade the casethat tokens such as bitcoin are built on hype and speculation, with people buying it only hoping to sell it for a profit to someone else. In contrast, a stock's value is underpinned by the company's cash flows and any dividends it pays out.

The hedge funds reshaping the entire industry — and leaving everyone else behind,"Welcome back!If you're feeling some kind of way about heading back to work, maybe hold off on that social media post. As much fun as it can be to vent, an ex-VP of HR at Microsoftsaid it's a fine line. In today's newsletter,four massive firms are dominating the hedge fund industryand leaving everyone else to figure out where they fit in. Markets:Hudson River Trading had a record year in 2024.Here's what went so well for the trading giant. Tech:Hulu's livestream of the Oscarswent dark during critical momentsof the awards ceremony. Business:Starbucks' CEO is six months on the job.How is he doing? (And what does it mean foryour morning coffee?) But first, don't even try to compete. If this was forwarded to you,sign up here. In the world of hedge funds, there are four big names — and then everyone else. Millennium, Citadel, Point72, and Balyasny have surpassed their peers by so muchit's reshaping the entire industry, writes Business Insider's Bradley Saacks. The fundraising ability, talent recruitment, and strong performance of those four multistrategy funds have made it almost impossible for up-and-comers to break in. The concentration at the top has several knock-on effects. For one, it makes an already competitive (and expensive) market for hiring even harder. One estimate last July of 18,600 people across 53 multistrategy firms found more than 71% worked for one of the big four. And if you can't attract the best talent, you might have a tougher time raising money from allocators, who are already keeping things close to the vest due to high interest rates. Those two factors make setting up your own fund a lot more intimidating than it used to be. Even investors with the highest pedigrees —former Millennium executive Bobby Jain— have faced challenges going out on their own. And besides, the days of a high-profile investor running a fund that attracts billions of dollars in investmentsare long gone. At the same time, one allocator told Bradley that Steve Cohen's Point72 has a $9 billionwaitlist, which is larger than most firms' total capital. As one person building a multi-strat fund put it to Bradley: ""If you're going to compete with Citadel and Millennium in their own backyard, you're already dead."" The end result could mean less competition, as investors might just stay with the biggest dogs on the block. Funds looking to stay afloat might try to think outside the box, lest they compete directly with one of the giants. That could mean catering to specific regions or focusing on more niche investments the big players wouldn't bother with. Still, the rise of the big four could be an opportunity for smaller players. With firms like Millennium and Citadellooking more like big banks, being nimble could be an asset. Specifically, using AI to help streamline work that a high-priced human might typically do could narrow the gap (and improve their margins). 1. Goodbye, WallStreetBets.

The gap between hedge fund haves and have-nots is wider than ever,"The four biggest multistrategy firms' dominance in the industry has made it harder for under-the-radar names to compete. For years, it was common knowledge thatsmaller hedge funds outperformed larger peers. Investors focused on finding up-and-coming managers before they made it big and raised billions. Big-name institutions like Blackstone and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas seeded new funds and sought out emerging managers. While there was safety and, typically, capacity in the biggest funds, there was alpha in unknown names. This has all changed with the yearslong industry takeover by the biggest multistrategy firms. The big four — Millennium, Citadel, Point72, and Balyasny — have in recent years outperformed peers despite their ballooning sizes, dominated the fundraising environment even though they're mostly closed to new money, and turned the talent market on its head with eye-popping offers for investors. For the first time, scale benefits both the manager and the LP, and the result is four managers with overwhelming clout. Business Insider talked to more than a dozen fund founders, allocators, and industry experts, such as top prime brokers and recruiters, to understand how smaller platforms plan to survive the unprecedented concentration of capital and talent and where allocators are turning in this new reality. Goldman Sachs' prime brokerage desk, using regulatory filings, estimated in July that 53 multistrategy firms employed a total of 18,600 people. More than 71% of them worked for one of the big four, leaving the 49 other funds with a combined head count smaller than Millennium's. Fundraising — which came easy for big and small platforms alike when interest rates were lower three years ago — is now a slog for many smaller multistrategy funds, several executives told Business Insider. The shift has cramped some firms' expansion plans that commenced during the boom times following the pandemic and put pressure on a business model that thrives with scale. Meanwhile, Point72 and Citadel have returned capital to investors, and Millennium can command a five-year lockup period for new money, a term length previously unheard of in the hedge fund world. One allocator told BI that Point72, the $39 billion firm run by the billionaire New York Mets owner Steve Cohen, had a $9 billion waitlist — which is more capital than firms like Eisler and Walleye manage. A different allocator compared the concentration of capital in the four largest firms to passive investing, in which all the assets flow to Vanguard, BlackRock, or State Street. ""For people who can't get into the top guys, they're saying they'll just invest in some other structure or asset class instead,"" this person said, pointing to private credit as a landing spot for some of this capital. The big four platforms have grown to a point where smaller rivals aren't battling another hedge fund — they're fighting with institutions. ""They're becoming more and more like investment banks to an extent,"" said one platform founder with less than $10 billion in total assets. Others in the industry likened Citadel in particular to pre-IPO Goldman Sachs — a comparisonKen Griffin would most likely welcome, given his laudatory comments about the firm. A hypothetical $5 billion multistrategy manager has a much different existence than even the $21 billion firm Balyasny. One smaller platform executive hoping to grow said that, even as Citadel and Point72 returned capital to LPs, ""it was a bitch last year raising money."" A February report from JPMorgan's capital advisory team said hedge funds with assets between $500 million and $5 billion had net outflows of $21.5 billion in the past two years, while firms with assets greater than $5 billion hauled in $12.2 billion in net new money. Goldman Sachs' July report noted that allocators were starting to balk at the high costs required to run multistrategy firms. The trickle-down effect is that firms such asExodusPoint have accepted a cash hurdle— where performance fees accrue only when returns surpass that of a Treasury bond — to appease antsy LPs. Despite the buzz aroundthe launch of Jain Global, the firm raised billions less than it was expected to pull in. Several smaller-platform executives said LPs were also worried about a platform unwind and what a significant market event could do to these firms, given that they operate with so much leverage. With more capital in multistrategy funds than ever before, some market watchers have been sounding the alarm about the knock-on effects of this investing style. These funds use borrowed money to juice their bets, meaning any significant movement against their position can cause losses to accumulate quickly. The risk-management systems of these platforms will often force their investors to shed positions quickly in the face of mounting losses, which can exacerbate a stock's decline. It's a market risk thatViking Global's chief investment officer, Justin Walsh, said he monitors closely and that the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, raised concerns about last month. But now that scale has become necessary for those competing directly with the four biggest firms, any slowdown in growth can be fatal, and suddenly tepid allocators could cause a domino effect, a former hedge fund allocator said. ""Without capital, you can't get a diversity of return streams,"" they said. ""Without a diversity of return streams, the model doesn't really make sense."" Those that can't beat the biggest players at their own game need to offer something different. ""If you're going to compete with Citadel and Millennium in their own backyard, you're already dead,"" one person who's building out their multistrategy offering told BI. They added, ""Do you have a right to exist — or are you on borrowed time because you raised money when all multistrats could raise money?"" Matthew Barrett, the head of manager research at Kepler Partners, who works with allocators searching for funds, said smaller platforms must offer a ""derivative"" of the main models the big four have perfected. For Dymon Asia, a $3 billion multistrategy fund with offices in Asia and the Middle East,the differentiator is geography. At SummitTX, Crestline Investors' recently rebrandedmultistrategy fund, ""what resonates is the alignment of the whole package,"" the firm's chief investment officer, Caroline Cooley, said. This includes fees, liquidity, transparency of positioning, and risk so that institutional investors have a more personalized setup. Other midsize shops focus on investment opportunities that are more niche and wouldn't move the needle at the biggest platforms. ""They need PMs to run $2 billion to $4 billion and manage seven to nine people,"" said Rich Schimel, who cofounded the $3 billion firm Cinctive Capital and once ran a stock-picking unit at Citadel. ""There are not a lot of people out there who can do that. Not efficiently, at least."" ""It's a whole different model than ours,"" he said. At his firm, he said, the focus is partially on ""low-hanging fruit"" in mid-cap stocks that are too small for the biggest funds, for example. The Holy Grail, though, might be finding a way to offer multistrategy returns at a fraction of the price. The pass-through fee structures nearly everyone has adopted to keep up inthe war for talenthave LPs on the hook for billions in employee compensation. Several allocators said a firm able to recreate multistrategy returns without relying on dozens of human portfolio managers would have plenty of backers. WhileDoug Haynes' Norias Researchnever ended up launching, reportedly because of aninability to raise sufficient capital,hedge fund LPs said his proposed firm's algorithm-driven and less-people-intensive structure made sense. And gross returns from a manager like this could be muted compared with high-head-count peers and still come out on top. ""If a full pass-through fee is 10%,"" Barrett said, ""you're already running at a significant head start."" Consolidation in top-heavy industries snowballs, and the multistrategy space is not immune. While the Millennium-Schonfeld tie-up was called off in 2023, the big four platforms have warped the industry by bringing independent external funds in-house and spinning off new firms backed by the mother ship. While there's optimism around hedge funds generally, a different Goldman report from last summer said that assets in the multistrategy industry had tapered off and that outflows outpaced performance gains through the first half of 2024. The talent pool can barely handle the big four, much less additional platforms hoping to replicate their models. ""There is definitely a difference between A talent and B talent, and you see it across different platforms,"" said Justin Young, the director of investments at Multilateral Endowment Management Company, an allocator that manages assets for Oklahoma State University's endowment and other institutions. Even those on the smaller end of the spectrum acknowledge there will probably be fewer platforms going forward. ""Are there too many? There could be,"" one founder with under $10 billion in assets said. ""There could be some consolidation.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/citadel-millennium-point72-balyasny-dominance-changed-the-hedge-fund-industry-2025-2
Here's how AWS is helping financial giants like JPMorgan and Bridgewater with their AI ambitions,"Generative AI has upped the ante in the public cloud war for Wall Street's wallet share. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, the cloud-computing arms of the respective Big Tech companies, have been duking it out to be the financial industry'sgo-to cloud provider. Strategies to win that business extended beyond just providing technology — many are now focusing on helping clients roll out AI. To keep its edge,Amazon saidit plans to deploy around $105 billion in its business, much of which will go toward AWS and its AI efforts. For a look at how that money may touch Wall Street, Business Insider spoke with John Kain, the head of financial services market development at AWS. Kain, who worked at JPMorgan Chase and Nasdaq before switching industries, outlined the future direction of AWS' Wall Street business through four different clients: two large international banks, a hedge fund, and a fintech. ""The tasks are getting more complex, things are becoming much more agentic in nature, much more tailored for individual use cases to get real price performance benefits,"" Kain said, referring to the industry's AI maturity. Much of the work behind the scenes has been around cutting down on the number ofhallucinations, a common issue where inaccurate responses are presented as fact. One example is with AWS Bedrock, a service that helps customers build generative AI applications and models. Last year, AWS introduced a feature called Bedrock Guardrails that looks at the responses coming out of large language models, and then uses another large language model to check whether that answer actually was a good response. In some cases, this approach detected about 75% of hallucinations, Kain said. Other AWS efforts, like automated reasoning, have tried to use mathematical proofs to prove that the information from generative AI models is factually correct. Here's how AWS is helping Wall Street firms use generative AI. AWS focus area: Security and scale WhenLori Beer, JPMorgan's global chief information officer, took the stage at AWS re:Invent in December, she charted the bank'sembrace of the cloud, which started in 2017. In 2020, JPM had 100 apps in the cloud, and it doubled that number the following year. It also built its UK consumer bank from the ground up on AWS. JPMorgan now has over a thousand applications running on AWS that fully take advantage of generative AI technologies, Kain said. JPMorgan's internal data and AI platform relies on AWS SageMaker, a tool for creating and training machine-learning models, with more than 5,000 employees using the cloud-based tool every month, Beer said. The bank has simplified the process of developing new models, from experimentation to deploying them live, she added. ""This platform is empowering us to build the next wave of AI applications at the firm,"" she said. Security, governance, and compliance measures in the cloud were key to JPMorgan's uptake, according to Kain. JPMorgan, which processes $10 trillion in payments daily and counts 82 million customers in the US, is considered the world's most systemically important bank,according tothe Financial Stability Board, which identifies global systemically important financial institutions. ""Organizations like JPMorgan, they have a unique scale and complexity that comes with being a globally regulated organization in multiple lines of business and we get to learn alongside of them,"" Kain said, adding that the bank's business compliance and security perspective helped drive AWS' roadmap forward. AWS focus area: coordinating specialized models for investment research About two years ago, Bridgewater pulled together a group of investors, data scientists, and technologists to rethink how the hedge fund understood markets and economies with AI and machine learning first. Thus, AIA Labs was born. Short for artificial investment associate, the division within the investment firm sought to recreate ""everything that we do via machine-learning techniques,"" Bridgewater's co-chief investment officer Greg Jensenpreviously told BI. ""It started on a notepad, graduated to Excel, and is now running on EKS and various other AWS services,"" AIA Labs CTO Aaron Linsky said at re:Invent in December. Early on, the capabilities on the generative AI side were mostly limited to asking a straightforward question, getting the AI to figure out how to write code to exract that data from Bridgewater's system, and produce a response, Kain said. ""That was great, it was saving hours and hours of time,"" he said, and made it so investment analysts didn't have to bug developers to get the data. Now, Bridgewater's AI platform can take a complex investing strategy and analyze it. ""They showed how they were able to take that complex investment question, break it into multiple steps, and have each of those steps go out to a particular agent,"" Kain said. For example, one agent may check how interest rates affect overall returns, another could double-check the financials, and a third may summarize the risk profile. ""We found today that limiting the breadth of responsibilities for any given agent is really important,"" Linsky said. ""We're on the path towards full agentic workflows,"" Linsky said, adding, ""we're definitely not replacing our investment associates with the capabilities right now, but it is helping to speed along their process."" AWS focus area: turning multiple data sets into new sales ideas Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, which offers everything from investment banking to treasury management and trade finance, is using generative AI to give its corporate salespeople a leg up. An AI platform that suggests sales ideas has led to a 30% conversion rate, Tetsuo Horigane, head of quant innovation at MUFG, said at re:Invent. MUFG began developing generative AI applications in 2023 after launching an in-house AI/ML team two years prior, Horigane said. MUFG also has about 2,000 employees serving roughly 1 million corporate clients, The bank's salespeople typically read through hundreds or thousands of pages of documents to understand a given client's situation and what financial product is most relevant to them. But now the AI platform combines multiple data sets, like the client's transaction history, previous sales conversions to understand what they're in the market for, their financial filings, and public information like news, Kain said. This process of drafting a sales pitch, which could take several hours or days, could now be done in a matter of minutes, Horigane said. AWS focus area: using call center AI to influence strategy and experience AI in call centers is nothing novel, but for Rocket Mortgage, it's leading executives to think about whole new strategies and experiences. The fintech integrated AWS's generative AI technology into its call centers to lessen the load for its thousands of call center employees who field calls, emails, and webchats every day. But the idea is not just to have one AI assistant, but ""an entire network of agents,"" Dan Vasquez, VP of AI strategy at Rocket Mortgage, said at re:Invent. They help with transcribing, picking out key pieces of information mid-call, and providing insights and data about the call after the fact, he said. Generative AI has helped save some 40,000 hours annually for call center employees and enabled 70% of client support to be fully self-served, Vasquez said. But now, Rocket Mortgage is using those 10 petabytes of data to figure out ""what should we do next?"" That's the real benefit, Kain said, for the fintech to start asking big questions like ""why are my customers calling me"" and ""what are my most common problems,"" and use that intel to rethink its online platforms, streamline workflows, and improve the overall customer experience.",https://www.businessinsider.com/aws-wall-street-jpmorgan-bridgewater-mufg-rocket-mortgage-2025-2
Hudson River Trading has quietly built an $8 billion global powerhouse,"While proprietary trading giants like Jane Street, Citadel Securities, and XTX Markets have dominated headlines in recent years, Hudson River Trading has quietly grown into a global powerhouse in its own right. In 2024, HRT's net trading revenue hit nearly $8 billion, an all-time high, according to people familiar with the matter. They asked to remain anonymous because the information is private. Like most of its competitors, HRT is private and reports little information publicly, so it's unclear how those results compare with prior years. But a research note from S&P Global said that through September, HRT had nearly doubled its earnings compared with 2023. The ratings agency said this helped increase the firm's credit rating one notch and illustrated HRT's success in diversifying and expanding its business. Its larger rivals Jane Street and Citadel Securities were also on pace for record years in 2024,Bloomberg reported. The bulk of the HRT trading profits — roughly half — come from the high-frequency trading business at its roots, known internally as its Classic business. But HRT has greatly expanded over the past half-decade, evolving into new markets and asset classes, such as systematic credit. The firm is now earning billions in profits from hedge-fund-style trading strategies that require greater risk and longer holding periods, and a unit dedicated to such strategies called Prism has become a key profit driver, the people said. A spokesman for HRT declined to comment. Founded in 2002 by a group of Harvard and MIT computer science and mathematics specialists, including Jason Carroll, a current managing partner, HRT is among the cadre of private trading firms that capitalized on the electronic-trading evolution in the late 1990s and 2000s, applying algorithms and state-of-the-art technology to markets. HRT started out trading US cash equities and now handles10% of the total stock-trading volume. But it has expanded significantly, trading in more than 200 markets across an array of asset classes, including futures, fixed income, currencies, options, and crypto. The expansion has doubled the firm's size over the past four years. HRT now has 14 offices around the world, with locations in global trading hubs but also in Austin; Boulder, Colorado; Shanghai; Mumbai, India; and Dublin. Employee head count has climbed to 1,110 from 500 in 2021. HRT's equity capital base has grown sixteenfold since 2018, according to S&P. In 2021, in a rare external media appearance, HRT revealed plans tobuild out a wholesale market-making business— handling order flow from brokers like Fidelity or Charles Schwab — to capitalize on the explosion of retail stock trading. It had grown that operation into a 4.7% market share by the end of September, according to S&P, though it's still far behind the likes of Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial. Proprietary trading firms have become dominant forces,wresting billions in market sharefrom global investment banks in recent years. Many firms experienced a jolt to their businesses in 2020 and 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to record market volatility and a substantial increase in retail trading. Most firms grew, but some have had more success than others. According to the financial publication International Financing Review, analysts estimate that in 2024, Jane Street, now the industry Goliath, reaped $20 billion and Citadel Securities about $10 billion. They have long lurked as secretive market players that mint billions of dollars in the shadows. Because they manage their own money, unlike hedge funds that do it on behalf of outside investors, they report little information to the outside world. While they remain closely guarded, this has started to change in recent years as their sizes and ambitions have ballooned. To fund their expansion, firms like Jane Street, Citadel Securities, and HRT have tapped debt capital markets, giving creditors and ratings agencies a peek under the hood. HRT issued a $2.1 billion term loan in November, primarily to refinance and extend existing liabilities. In research reports related to the debt offering, both Moody's and S&P noted that HRT consistently had strong earnings across a more diverse set of strategies since 2022. ""Sturdy and consistent trading profits have led to improvements in HRT's funding and liquidity, evidenced by consistent growth in trading capital, equity capital, and related improvements in its trading capital/debt,"" Moody's said. Prop trading firms have traditionally relied on automated programs and speed to mint their profits — continuously buying and selling securities almost instantaneously and collecting tiny profits that add up to millions of dollars a day. But there's a finite pool of money in market making, and it's fiercely fought over. Prop trading firms have increasingly dipped their toes into strategies more associated with hedge funds, where potentially even greater profits, but also risks, lie. So-called mid-frequency strategies can happen over minutes, hours, or even days. Profits are won by the strength of predictive signals, developed through onerous statistical research and increasingly aided by artificial intelligence. At HRT, Prism is the marquee unit focused on such trades — an increasingly profitable operation that generated more than $2 billion last year, according to people familiar with the business. Strategies span asset classes including equities, futures, rates, and credit, but ETF arbitrage and index rebalance have been noteworthy and profitable strategies in recent years, the people said. Equity statistical arbitrage and quant macro are newer units that have also driven recent growth in head count and profits, the people familiar with the matter said. While still automated and mathematically driven, longer-duration trades require more capital and come with greater risks. There's more time for markets and savvier opponents to move against you — winning signals can decay, and predictions can go awry. According to S&P, the reality of such risks reared its head in the second quarter of 2022, a rare instance of HRT posting a loss. That August, Moody's downgraded HRT, citing increased risks that ""leave HRT more susceptible to trading losses."" But since then, Moody's wrote in its November credit opinion, HRT has produced ""robust, consistent trading profits across a more diverse range of products and strategies,"" even as market volatility faded and spreads in market making tightened.",https://www.businessinsider.com/hudson-river-trading-hrt-8-billion-trading-revenue-2025-3
How Warren Buffett is preparing for his 60-year Berkshire Hathaway reign to end,"Warren Buffetthas spent the past 60 years transforming Berkshire Hathaway from a failing textile mill into a $1 trillion company that's more valuable than Tesla, Walmart, or JPMorgan. Thelegendary investortook control of Berkshire in 1965 and has steadily acquired scores of businesses including Geico and See's Candies, and built multibillion-dollar stakes in public companies including Apple and Coca-Cola. But at 94 years of age, the business titan knows the end of the Buffett era is near at hand — and he's carefullypaved the way for his departure. Buffett has warned his shareholders the clock is ticking on his time in charge. He's talked upGreg Abeland set the stage for his planned successor. He's also sought to protect his legacy and ensure his vast fortune isn't squandered once he's gone. ""Succession planning is the most important thing in corporate governance for a company led by an iconic CEO,"" Lawrence Cunningham, the director of the University of Delaware's Weinberg Center on Corporate Governance and the author of several books about Buffett and Berkshire, told Business Insider. Buffett's conglomerate is ""providing an exemplary and under-appreciated model for how this can be done well,"" Cunningham continued, adding that it has ""prepared the way not only for Greg to succeed Warren as CEO"" but also prepared stockholders for their company to no longer have a controlling shareholder. ""At 94, it won't be long before Greg Abel replaces me as CEO and will be writing the annual letters,"" Buffett said in hisrecent missiveto Berkshire shareholders, making it explicit he'll hand over the reins soon. The billionaire bargain hunter has repeatedly reassured stockholders that Abel is aworthy successor. In his new letter, he wrote that in those rare moments when opportunities are everywhere, Abel has ""vividly shown his ability to act at such times as did Charlie,"" referring to his late business partner,Charlie Munger. Buffett joked during last year's annual meeting that shareholders ""don't have too long to wait"" for a change in management. ""I feel fine, but I know a little about actuarial tables,"" he quipped. The investor mentioned in his latest letter that he requires a cane to walk, perhaps because he's ""considering the possibility of stepping down as CEO in the near future,"" David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland who's been closely following Buffett's company for four decades, told BI. He added that the nonagenarian might announce the decision as soon as Berkshire's annual meeting in May. Buffett appears to beclearing the decksbefore the next captain takes over the ship. Berkshire's $334 billion cash mountain may reflect a ""desire to hand a relatively clean slate to Greg"" and enable him to ""more easily perform the main function of a CEO, which is allocating capital,"" Kass told BI. More specifically, he and his investment managers havesold several small but long-held investmentsincluding General Motors and Procter & Gamble in recent years. They've alsocashed in $158 billionworth of stocks on a net basis in just the past two years, which has helped to boost Berkshire's cash pile to record levels. Their efforts could leave plenty of dry powder for Abel to spend on stocks or finally bag the elephant-sized acquisition that has evaded Buffett for years. Buffett and his deputies might be pulling back on purchases, ramping up sales, and halting buybacks because stock valuations have grown too expensive. But they might also see value in leaving a treasure chest for Abel to draw from and deploy as he wishes. Buffettdisclosed last yearthat when he dies, his roughly 14% stake in Berkshire — worth more than $150 billion — will pass into a trust that counts his three children as trustees, and they'll have to vote unanimously on how it's spent. Theplannot only protects the money from the taxman and earmarks it for worthy causes, it also aims to thwart activist investors who might otherwise seek to buy up Buffett's shares once he's gone and clamor for his conglomerate to be dismantled. ""I regard Berkshire Hathaway sort of like a painter regards a painting, the difference being the canvas is unlimited,"" Buffettsaid in 2016, underlining his vision that the company will persist for generations. In fact, Buffett's efforts to prepare his shareholders for the inevitable, voice his confidence in Abel and set him up for success, and protect his personal stake in the business, all speak to his devotion to ensuring Berkshire thrives long after he's gone.",https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-succession-planning-greg-abel-stock-billionaires-2025-2
Citi's latest blunder: an $81 trillion 'inputting error',"Citigroup's fat-finger blunders may not be over. The Wall Street bank accidentally credited a client's account with $81 trillion instead of $280, the Financial Timesreported on Friday. This followed the accidental transfer of$900 millionin 2020 to Revlon creditors due to human error and outdated technology. A Citi spokesperson did not confirm the figures involved to Business Insider but described the latest incident as an ""inputting error"" that highlighted improvements to the bank's operational controls because no money was transferred out of the bank. ""Despite the fact that a payment of this size could not actually have been executed, our detective controls promptly identified the inputting error between two Citi ledger accounts, and we reversed the entry, "" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""Our preventative controls would have also stopped any funds leaving the bank,"" the spokesperson said, adding that there was ""no impact to the bank or our client."" The mishap came amid Citi CEO Jane Fraser's efforts to convince shareholders and regulators that she's turning the bank around. It points to Citi's struggle to iron out the kinks in itstech and compliance frameworks— the central goal of a sweeping, multiyear plan called theTransformation, which aims to help the bank prove to regulators that its risk controls have improved over the years. This is the latest in a series of glitches for Citi, which has had to pay US regulators $400 million in fines over its data management and risk controls. In July, shortly after the $81 trillion mistake, Citi was hit with $135.6 million in fines for failing to make enough progress to satisfy the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. British regulators also fined Citiabout $79 million in May for a 2022 incident in which a Citi employee accidentally added a zero to a trade, which caused a flash crash in Europe. The blunders and fines add to the mounting pressure on Fraser, who inherited the bank's outdated systems and regulatory issues when she took over in March 2021. US Sen. Elizabeth Warren in October urged the OCC to place growth restrictions on Citi, saying the bank had become ""too big to manage."" Fraser has dedicated billions of dollars to a firmwide initiative to overhaul the bank's technology. The bank has about12,000 employeesworking on its Transformation project, which is overseen by the Citi consumer-bank veteranAnand Selva. After the July fines, Fraser tapped Tim Ryan, the bank's head of tech, to lead the effort to improve its data controls alongside Selva. Fraser has defended Citi's progressin earnings calls, reiterating that improving its systems is a yearslong process. ""We know what we need to do,"" she said on a fourth-quarter earnings call with analysts in January. ""We've got our arms around all of this. We're just getting on with execution.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/citis-fat-finger-blunder-81-trillion-jane-fraser-2025-2
KPMG becomes first Big Four firm to break into the US legal market,"KPMG will become the first of the Big Four to set up a legal division in the US after the Arizona Supreme Court granted it a special license to practice law. KPMGwas approved to operate as an alternative business structure, or ABS, in Arizona — a license that enables it to establish KPMG Law US as an independent law firm. The new entity will bring together technology and legal advice at scale, reshaping the market for legal services, KPMG said in a statement. Its offerings will include legal managed services, legal operations consulting, and legal technology innovation. ""KPMG Law US is uniquely positioned to transform the delivery of legal services,"" said Rema Serafi, KPMG's vice chair of tax. ""By combining cutting-edge artificial intelligence and advanced technology solutions with legal services, we are proud to be a first mover with this capability and to offer the most holistic range of tech-enabled services in the marketplace for our clients' evolving needs."" The US is the world's largest market forlegal services. It is mostly closed off to nonlegal professionals by an American Bar Association rule that only permits licensed lawyers to own or invest in law firms. While the Big Four have set up legal divisions in other key markets, they have only operated advisory, audit, and tax divisions in the US until now. Arizona's ABS program sidesteps the rule and grants nonlegal professionals a license to provide legal services. More than 100 firms have been approved to practice law in the state since the ABS program began in 2021. Arizona is not alone in offering market access to non-legal professionals. Washington has allowed limited nonlawyer ownership since 1991, and Utah is running a similar trial to the ABS program. Lucy Ricca, executive director at Stanford Law School's Deborah L. Rhode Center on the Legal Profession, told Business Insider that Arizona's ABS reforms were intended to widen the public's access to legal services. ""The Arizona ABS reforms are market-based reforms, intended to open the power of capital, diversification, and competition in a sector, legal services, that has been stunted by the professional monopoly of lawyers,"" she said. Critics of the program argue that nonlawyer ownership in law firms creates aconflict of interestand undermines the professional independence of lawyers. KPMG Law US will operate within each state's ethics rules in line with every other law firm, the firm said. As a condition of its ABS license, KPMG will not be allowed to provide legal services to clients for which it also performs financial audits, the Arizona Supreme Court said in a statement. The Arizona court's decision signals further expansion for KPMG's tax and legal division, which was thefastest-growing arm of its businessin its last financial year — up 10% globally. KPMG Law US will not be limited to Arizona. It will also serve clients across the US by partnering, offering co-counsel, or referring to separate staffing firms and other law firms, subject to state rules. Kirsten Keegan Vasquez, vice president of the legal recruiter Major, Lindsey & Africa, told BI that she doesn't expect KPMG to swiftly disrupt the market. ""Legal services are hired based on long-term proven track record. Any new entry into the market is going to have to overcome that competitive energy,"" she said. However, Vasquez expected KPMG's move to create more competition for top talent and clients among big law firms. Stanford's Lucy Ricca added: ""There certainly will be winners and losers as the market grows and changes, but those pressures already exist in many ways. ""Every new entrant represents a growing and more dynamicmarket for legal servicesand a growing diversity in the supply of legal services. It means more competition, yes, but this is a market that has been stunted by a lack of real competition for decades.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/kpmg-law-firm-big-four-us-legal-services-market-arizona-2025-2
I thought paying $525 a year for the United Club Infinite Card would fix my travel woes until I realized the perks I actually need cost way less,"For years, my husband and I regularly traveled for work enough to earn Premier status on United Airlines. We loved it — the Premier security lanes at some airports literally saved us hours of travel time. However, to reach Premier status, you need to fly a minimum of four United flights a year and earn at least 6,000 Premier qualifying points. We've both been traveling less lately and sadly don't qualify anymore. We miss it so much that I've been looking into getting aUnited credit cardin hopes of replacing those Premier-status perks. I found a few options: the $0-annual-feeUnited Gateway℠ Card, the $95-annual-fee ($0 intro for the first year) United℠ Explorer Card, the $250-annual-fee United Quest℠ Card, and the $525-annual-fee United Club℠ Infinite Card. All of them offerbonus miles, extra points when making United and everyday purchases, and no foreign transaction fees. However, only the United Club℠ Infinite Card comes with automatic Premier status. Before signing up for it, though, I wanted to see if the hefty annual fee would be worth it for me. Automatic Premier status is the card's big selling point for me. Beyond Priority security lanes, one of the reasons I love the status is earlier boarding. The highest Premier 1K level automatically gets you pre-boarding, Premier Gold and Premier Platinum board in Group 1, and Premier Silver boards in Group 2. TheUnited Club Infinite Carditself also gives you access topriority boardingin Group 2. In my experience, yourcarry-on bagisn't getting in the overhead bin if you're in any boarding group after Group 3 on a full United flight. The most basic priority boarding typically costs at least $24 a person per flight, so the savings can add up. Some of the card's other big perks are the high earning rates for points and miles and United Club access. The Club is anexclusive airport loungewhere members can grab snacks, work before flights with free WiFi, and chat with customer service about flight delays or cancellations. That membership alone usually costs about $650 a year — that's already higher than the card's annual fee. With or without Premier status, the card also gives you two free checked bags on every flight. However, if I make it to Premier Platinum or Premier 1K, I could get up to three bags for free. I recently checked two bags on a United flight from Vancouver to Chicago that cost me $70 each way, so it would only take a few flights to get to the card's annual fee amount. Additionally, the card gives holders $120 towardGlobal Entry, TSA PreCheck®, or NEXUS — which I think of as a bonus security-skipping credit. Overall, the United Club℠ Infinite Card sounded great, but I was still hesitant. Despite the compelling case I just made for the United Club℠ Infinite Card, we aren't going to sign up for it. I'm sure it's of excellent value for some frequent travelers, but we can't financially justify the upfront cost of theannual fee— even if we'd eventually ""make all the money back."" Fancy perks, like the Club membership, distracted me a bit at first. However, that membership isn't something we would've otherwise purchased, so I can't say we'd actually be saving that money by getting it for free. Instead, we sat down and really thought about our travel priorities: faster security, priority boarding, and free checked bags. TheUnited Quest Cardhas a $250 annual fee, which can be partially offset the first year by its perk of a $125 United purchase credit. It doesn't come with Premier status, but I would get 500 Premier Qualifying Points (PQPs) for signing up and earn one additional point for every $20 spent. Premier Silver status — the lowest level — costs 6,000 PQPs. That's a lot of credit card purchases to get Premier status, but it's possible. Even if I can't make it to Premier status, the United Quest℠ Card offers free priority boarding, twofree checked bags, and many of the other smaller perks the United Club℠ Infinite Card offers — including the $120 security-skipping credit. If I wanted an even less expensive card, I could try theUnited Explorer Card. Its annual fee is actually waived the first year — a great upfront win. I'd earn fewer miles and could only earn up to 1,000 PQPs through spending on the card. But I'd still get priority boarding, one free checked bag, the $120 security-skipping credit, and other basic perks. Additionally, the United Explorer Card comes with two free United Club passes a year, so my husband and I could have an annualluxurious airport experience. I was originally dead set on getting a United credit card that guaranteed us the Premier status we love so much. Although the card that offers it isn't a perfect match for us, I'm glad I did more research before applying for the card. This process helped me narrow down the perks that can actually save us money while stillimproving our travel experience. By going with the United Quest℠ Card or United℠ Explorer Card cards, we can still access priority boarding in Group 2 — meaning we likely wouldn't have to worry about our carry-ons making it on the plane — and check one or two bags for free. We could also use the $120 credit that comes with the cards to sign up for something like TSA Precheck toget through security faster. Plus, we won't have to spend $525 every year to get those perks. The rates and fees in this post are accurate as of 2/27/25.",https://www.businessinsider.com/cheaper-way-best-travel-perks-avoid-high-annual-card-fee-2025-2

If available, the arbitration will be administered by the National Arbitration and Mediation (""NAM"") and resolved before a single arbitrator. In no event shall any arbitration be administered by the American Arbitration Association (""AAA""). Except as modified by this section 17, NAM will administer the arbitration according to applicable NAM rules and procedures available atwww.namadr.comor by emailing NAM's Commercial Dept atcommercial@namadr.com. If you are initiating arbitration, a copy of the demand shall also be emailed tolegal@businessinsider.com. If Business Insider is initiating arbitration, it will serve a copy of the demand to the email address associated with your Business Insider account. Subject to NAM rules and procedures, the arbitrator will have discretion to allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute. Unless prohibited by law, all arbitration proceedings will be confidential and closed to the public and any parties other than you and Business Insider (and each party's authorized representatives and agents), and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed to the extent permitted by law. e.Batch Arbitration. If 100 or more similar arbitration demands (asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted to NAM (or another non-AAA arbitration provider selected if NAM is unavailable) against Business Insider within reasonably close proximity (""Mass Filing""), the parties agree (i) to administer the Mass Filing in batches of 100 demands per batch (a final batch may consist of the remaining demands if less than 100) with only one batch filed, processed, and adjudicated at a time; (ii) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; (iii) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined in the arbitrator's discretion; (iv) that no other arbitration demands that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the prior batch of 100 is filed, processed, and adjudicated; (v) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by Business Insider and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a set of batch proceedings and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; and (vi) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each set including 100 demands, shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved. Arbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted to the greatest extent possible according to applicable NAM rules and procedures, and the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings will be conducted.You agree to cooperate in good faith with Business Insider and the arbitration provider to implement such a ""batch approach"" or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims.Any disagreement between the parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator appointed by NAM. This ""Batch Arbitration"" provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM's Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Unless Business Insider otherwise consents in writing, Business Insider does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in clause 13(c) above and this clause 13(g). If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled. f.Arbitrator's Decision, Fees. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant, on an individual basis, any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual to the extent available under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and this Arbitration Agreement. The parties agree that the damages and/or other relief must be consistent with clause 13(c) above and also must be consistent with the terms of the ""Limitation of Liability"" section 16 above as damages or other relief for which Business Insider may be held liable. No arbitration award or decision will be preclusive of issues or claims in any dispute with persons not a named party to the arbitration. Attorneys' fees will be available to the prevailing party only if authorized under the substantive law governing the claims. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions according to NAM rules and procedures for any frivolous claims or submissions the arbitrator determines were not filed in good faith, and for a party's failure to comply with the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure in clause 17(a). You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise. g.Right to Opt-Out of the Arbitration Agreement.

Other persons and entities follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the information you submit to them or they collect from you. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those other parties. We may offer blogs, social media profiles, message boards, bulletin boards, or similar public forums where you and other users of our Service can post content or otherwise communicate. If you post personal information on a public forum, we will assume you intend to make that personal information public. We may use your name to identify you with a posting in a public forum and may use your post on or in connection with our Service (e.g., when using a hashtag associated with Business Insider in a tweet or status update). Any personal information you disclose in a public forum is public information and may be seen or collected by other persons, including third parties that do not adhere to the standards set forth in this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for events that may arise from the distribution of any information you choose to publicly post or share through our online services. In addition, to the extent you interact with social networks or other services through the Service (such as “liking” or “sharing” our content or otherwise connecting our Service to a social network), information collected and stored by those other parties through your interaction or pages that contain their tracking technologies remains subject to their policies and practices, including whether they disclose information about you to us, the types of information disclosed, and your choices on what is visible to others. We are not responsible for and make no representations regarding the policies or business practices of any other parties or their services and encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. Our Service may contain tracking technologies owned and operated by other parties. For example, we use tracking technologies from analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to help us understand how users access and use the Service. Our app does not use these technologies for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes. We may also work with ad networks, advertisers, agencies, and other technology services to place advertisements on our website and/or other websites and services. These parties may set and access cookies and other technologies on your personal computer and/or device and track certain behavioral information regarding users of your personal computer and/or device. As noted above, these website cookies and other technologies are set to, among other things: (a) track your activities across time and services for purposes of measuring conversions or actions you take, associating different devices you use, and serving ads and/or other content targeted to your interests (“Interest-based Advertising”); (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. We may also use audience matching services (which is a type of Interest-Based Advertising) to reach people (or similar audiences) who have visited our website or are identified in one or more of our databases. For example, we may disclose hashed email addresses to an ad partner to determine if there are common matching factors between our data and their data in order to serve you more personalized ads. As discussed above, vendors and ad partners may act as our Service Providers, or in certain contexts, independently decide how to process your information. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. For further information on your choices regarding these third party tracking technologies, please see the section entitled “Your Advertising Choices” below. Cookies and location-identifying technologies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your device. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies some parts of the Service may not work and that when you revisit the Service your ability to limit browser-based tracking technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations. Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals or other mechanisms. We do, however, respond to global privacy preferences when required by law. You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going tohttps://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptoutand downloading the Google Analytics Opt Out Browser Add-on. Some of the advertisers and vendors that perform advertising-related services for us and our partners participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visithttp://www.aboutads.info/choices, andhttp://www.aboutads.info/appchoicesfor information on the DAA’s opt out program for mobile applications. Some of these companies are also members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt out options for their members, see http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Business Insider is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third parties’ opt out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. Additionally, we may collaborate with our service providers and identity partners (""Identity Resolution Partners"") to deliver targeted advertising and identify the different devices and browsers you may use to access our Services. We and our Identity Resolution Partners may facilitate identity resolution by creating probabilistic and deterministic identifiers. These identifiers may use personal information, including your name, email address, phone number, and Activity Information to generate an online identifier reasonably linkable to you and/or your device or browser. For example, we may disclose hashed email address, phone number, or other information about your device to our Identity Resolution Partners, whom may, in turn, return an online identifier that we may store in a first party cookie or similar technology and disclose to our advertising partners to provide you a more personalized advertising experience. These identifiers also help us with fraud detection and security, enforce our Terms of Service, among other things. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our Identity Resolution Partners, which are separate from our own and not covered by this Privacy Policy. You may have additional rights related to these technologies depending on your state of residency, as outlined in Section 12 below. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, please follow any unsubscribe instructions provided in our communications to you, update your user preferences via our subscription management tools on our Service, or contact us as set forth in the section below entitled “Contact Us”, and specify your request. Please note that you cannot opt out of non-promotional e-mails, and we may use your information to contact you with important notifications, such as notices with respect to purchases, safety, or changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Also, your unsubscribe is limited to the e-mail address or phone number used for that particular subscription and will not affect subsequent subscriptions. Residents of Applicable States (as defined above), the European Economic Area, and the United Kingdom, have specific rights with respect to our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. Please review our location-specific sections below for more information about those rights. We employ appropriate security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and are not responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information. If you suspect unauthorized use of personal information that you have provided us – such as your account information or its credentials – you should notify us immediately using the information in the Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy. We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law. Remember that even after you cancel your account, or if you ask us to delete your personal information, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared information with social media or other services. Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others. We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancellation or your request for deletion, for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security or recordkeeping policies. It may not always be possible to completely remove or delete all of your information due to technical constraints or contractual, financial or legal requirements. Our Services are hosted in and managed from the United States. If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information processed in the United States or in any other country in which we have facilities or in which we engage service providers. The United States and other countries’ data protection laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in the United States may be entitled to access your personal information. To the extent that the Company offers products and services to individuals located in the European Economic Area or United Kingdom, or to the extent the Service is deliberately made available to such individuals, please review the section titled “Additional Disclosures for Data Subjects in Europe and United Kingdom” below for more information about disclosures and privacy rights associated with that activity. We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make changes, we will revise this Privacy Policy to reflect such changes and revise the effective date included at the beginning of this policy. We may provide you with additional notice (such as to your e-mail address) if the changes are material. Your use of the Service following any such notice will signify and constitute your assent to and acceptance of such revised Privacy Policy.

Depending on where you live, you may have certain additional rights regarding your personal information. This section provides information for consumers residing in Applicable States, in connection with the laws in those states, and other states with similar privacy laws (“Applicable Laws”). Under these Applicable Laws, and for purposes of this Section, “Personal Data” and/or “Personal Information” generally mean information that identifies, relates to, or describes a resident in one of the Applicable States and, depending on the state of residency, may also include information that is linkable or linked to a device. Personal information does not include publicly available information; lawfully obtained, truthful information that is a matter of public concern; information that has been deidentified or aggregated; or other information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws, as consistent with state law. We do not reidentify Personal Data and/or Personal Information that has been deidentified. We and our advertising partners use certain Personal Data and/or Personal Information to deliver online advertisements to you on your devices tailored to your interests when you visit our website.

If you are a resident of an Applicable State, you may have the following rights with respect to any information about you that constitutes “Personal Information” or “Personal Data” depending on your state of residence. We are required by law to verify your identity in connection with any request in order to prevent unauthorized access of your data.

We may also contact the consumer directly to verify his or her own identity and that the consumer granted you authorization to act on their behalf as an authorized agent.

If you are an authorized agent trying to exercise rights on behalf of a consumer, please contact us at the contact information above with supporting verification information, which should include proof that you have the consumer’s authorization to act.

Our California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) metrics for the previous calendar year are as follows: Number of requests to delete that were received, complied with in whole or in part, and denied: 623 Number of requests to correct that were received, complied with in whole or in part, and denied: 2 Number of requests to opt out of sale/sharing that were received, complied with in whole or in part, and denied: 89 The median or mean number of days it took to substantively respond (i.e not the 10 day “confirmation of receipt” window); 15.50 days Customers who are residents of California may request (i) a list of the categories of personal information disclosed by us to third parties during the immediately preceding calendar year for those third parties’ own direct marketing purposes; and (ii) a list of the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed such information. To exercise a request, please write us at the email or postal address set out in “Contact Us” section above and specify that you are making a “California Shine the Light Request.” We may require additional information from you to allow us to verify your identity and are only required to respond to requests once during any calendar year. This section applies to any individuals located within the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any jurisdiction to which similar privacy laws apply, from whom we may have collected personal data from any source, including through your use of our Services.  We provide this Notice to comply with applicable privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Act (“GDPR”), the UK GDPR, and related laws, regulations, and guidance from the European Union and/or its member states.  Any capitalized term used and not otherwise defined below has the meaning assigned to it in our Privacy Policy. For the purposes of this Notice, “personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. EU and UK data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “data controllers”) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as “data processors”). Both Business Insider and EMARKETER may act as either a data controller or a data processor in respect of your personal data, depending on the circumstances. We generally act as data controller with respect to information you provide through the Service. Sometimes we operate as a data processor on behalf of a client, a separate legal entity, which is the data controller. For example, if you subscribe to our newsletters and promotional communications, we may send you content on behalf of our clients and share your personal data with our clients for their own marketing purposes. Please visit the applicable client’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. Any questions that you may have relating to such personal data and your rights under data protection law should therefore be directed to the client as the data controller, not to Business Insider or EMARKETER. We rely on one or more legal bases to process your personal data under applicable law.  We may process personal data (i) as necessary to perform our contractual obligations to you, including, but not limited to, those obligations in our terms of use; (ii) as necessary to pursue our legitimate interests as further detailed below; (iii) as necessary for our compliance with our legal obligations such as a request or order from courts, law enforcement or other government authorities; and/or (iv) with your consent, including to send you marketing email messages and other information that may be of interest to you, which you may withdraw at any time. We may collect, process, and maintain personal data to pursue the legitimate business interests outlined below.  To determine these legitimate interests, we balance our legitimate interests against the legitimate interests and rights of you and others and only process personal data in accordance with those interests where they are not overridden by your data-protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. While our legitimate interests are most extensively detailed in Section 3 of this Privacy Policy, they generally include: Provide, improve, and develop our Service, including to deliver your requested Services, send you messages and provide user support, customize the Services to better fit your needs as a user, develop new Services, and perform internal analytics and research and development. This also includes sharing personal data with our trusted service providers that provide services on our behalf. Protect you and others and to create and maintain a trusted environment, such as to comply with our legal obligations, to ensure compliance our agreements with you and other third parties, to ensure safe, secure, and reliable Services, and to detect and prevent wrongdoing and crime, assure compliance with our policies, and protect and defend our rights, interests, and property. In connection with the activities above, we may conduct internal research and profiling based on your interactions on various Sites, content you submit to the Sites, and information obtained from third parties. Provide, personalize, measure and improve our marketing, including to send you promotional messages and other information that may be of interest to you with your consent. We may also use personal data to understand our user base and the effectiveness of our marketing.  This processing is done pursuant to our legitimate interest in undertaking marketing activities to offer products or services that may be of interest to you. If you are a data subject in a jurisdiction identified in this section, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you through the Service. You also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you through the Service. In addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us. To exercise any of these rights, please contact us atprivacy@businessinsider.comand specify which right you intend to exercise. For EMARKETER, please email your request atprivacy@emarketer.com. We will respond to your request within 30 days. We may require additional information from you to allow us to confirm your identity. Further, if we are processing your information on behalf of one of our clients, we will refer you to that client, and will support them to the extent required by applicable law in responding to your request. Please note that we store information as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, and may continue to retain and use the information even after a data subject request for purposes of our legitimate interests, including as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements. If you have any issues with our compliance or you believe that we have not complied with our obligations under this Privacy Policy or European or UK law, you have the right to make a complaint to an EU Data Protection Authority, such as the UK Information Commissioner's Office.  You can view the contact information for your data protection authorityhere. We will only retain your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for. We will retain and use your information as necessary to satisfy any legal, accounting or reporting requirements, to resolve disputes or to enforce our agreements and rights. In line with this Privacy Policy, we will either securely delete or anonymize your data so that it cannot be linked back to you. We will not transfer personal data originating from the EU to third parties located outside of the EU without ensuring adequate protection under European or UK law. Where transfer is to a party located in a third country not recognized by the EU Commission as ensuring an adequate level of protection, we will take appropriate steps to transfer the personal data subject to adequate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses as well as other appropriate measures and safeguards.",https://www.businessinsider.com/privacy-policy

Code of Ethics Policy,"This Business Insider Code of Ethics (“Code”) provides guidance for some of the more common ethical issues that our employees may encounter and is intended to preserve the integrity of our news coverage. The Code applies to all our employees, except where it is noted that a specific provision applies only to journalists or editorial staff. The Code is not exhaustive, however, and we expect our employees to always act professionally and ethically. When in doubt, reach out to your manager for guidance. All employees must avoid Conflicts of Interest whenever possible. A Conflict of Interest occurs when an employee’s professional, personal or financial interests or affiliations compromise, or appear to compromise, Business Insider’s status as an unbiased news source. Any employee who anticipates an unavoidable Conflict of Interest must immediately disclose such Conflict to Talent attalent@businessinsider.comor to the employee’s Managing Editor. In certain cases, Business Insider will decide that a Conflict of Interest may be mitigated through a published disclosure. In other cases, it will be necessary for Business Insider to modify or re-staff an assignment or beat. Regardless, Business Insider expects all our employees--including and especially the editorial staff--to work cooperatively with Business Insider to effectively identify and resolve any Conflict of Interest that may arise. Business Insider does not accept remuneration from the subjects of its news articles. Likewise, our journalists may not accept cash or anything else of value in exchange for promoting an entity or a cause in connection with our publication. Articles that are co-sponsored with other entities will include a published disclosure. On occasion, our journalists may be offered reimbursement for travel expenses. Journalists are required to notify Business Insider before accepting any such offer and Business Insider retains the right to decide on a case-by-case basis whether acceptance is appropriate and disclosure is needed. Regardless, acceptance of travel expenses will not influence the content or perspective of our editorial coverage. Our journalists may accept free admission to an event, performance or political gathering provided that they intend to cover that event on behalf of Business Insider. Any benefits or other perquisite of greater than nominal value must be declined unless also available for free to the general public. Our journalists may keep swag, promotional items and/or tchotchkes received in the course of covering a story, so long the total value of these items is less than $100, and only provided that acceptance of such items in no way compromises the independence and neutrality of our coverage. Journalists must return or donate books, music and other products received for review. Under no circumstances may our journalists keep, sell or give away any item acquired to review in the course of their employment with Business Insider. Our journalists may also not offer payment, gifts or coverage in exchange for access to, or information from, a source. An exception may be made in certain limited circumstances where such payment is customary, lawful and transparent. For example, a food critic may purchase a meal from a restaurant that they review. Business Insider may also reimburse sources for certain standard travel expenses as necessary. Our journalists must consult with a Managing Editor before offering any kind of remuneration on Business Insider’s behalf. Editorial staff may not solicit favors, job offers or internships from any person or entity they encounter while acting within the scope of their employment with Business Insider. Furthermore, editorial staff may not offer jobs, internships or benefits on behalf of Business Insider to any person or entity in exchange for access, information or other assistance with a story. Our journalists must maintain editorial independence when working with advertisers. While Business Insider does produce co-sponsored promotional content, under no circumstances is any journalist permitted to deceive, misrepresent or fail to include material information in the course of creating that content. Business Insider’s sponsored content must always be clearly identified in accordance with applicable regulatory guidelines, whether such content is posted on Business Insider’s website or through any affiliated social media accounts. Business Insider employees cannot serve as a director, officer or board member for any for-profit or non-profit organization without the express permission of senior management. Employees are expected to promptly disclose any director, officer or board membership positions that predate their employment and/or to seek consent from Business Insider prior to serving on the board of any for-profit or non-profit entity. Additionally, employees must promptly disclose information regarding any organization for which any member of the employee’s family, household or other close relation acts as officer or director. Business Insider encourages its employees (including its editorial staff) to participate actively in civic, charitable, religious, public, social or residential organizations as long as their participation: Does not detract from their performance, or the effectiveness of their work; Does not cause Business Insider to appear to subsidize or support a particular activity or cause; Does not throw into question the integrity, independence or fairness of Business Insider’s editorial judgment; and Does not otherwise violate this Code. Employees may attend and observe political rallies and events. Editorial staff, however, must refrain from any activities that could be construed as supporting a candidate or political party. All employees are encouraged to participate in non-partisan demonstrations or marches concerning human rights issues, social inequities and the defense of non-partisan civil liberties.

Notwithstanding anything otherwise set forth in this Code (including with respect to items valued at less than $100), editorial staff may not accept awards, per diems, stipends, scholarships, certificates, gifts, benefits or prizes for their journalism from corporate or partisan committees or special interest groups. Furthermore, editorial staff may not act as judges in any competitions sponsored by the foregoing entities, nor may they enter themselves as a participant or contestant. The acceptance of honorary degrees, medals and other awards from educational institutions and/or the publishing industry is permitted so long as such awards are of nominal financial value. All employees are expected to refrain from any conduct that might create the appearance that: An employee, or anyone connected to an employee, including members of that employee’s household, used non-public “inside” information obtained through Business Insider employment to make decisions about their financial investments; Business Insider editorial content was influenced by a desire to affect the price of any security; or Business Insider endorses or encourages the acquisition of an ownership interest in any particular for-profit entity. In making personal investments, all employees must avoid speculation or the appearance of speculation on a change in price of any security. No Business Insider employee, nor any member of their household, may short sell securities. Editorial and advertising employees, as well as members of senior management with discretion over editorial or advertising content, and any member of their household, may not: Buy or sell securities in any company that engages in significant activity, or otherwise specializes, in any industry that the employee regularly covers; or Engage in short-term trading of equity securities or non-investment grade fixed income securities. Such securities must be held for a minimum of six months, unless the holder receives express permission from Business Insider to sell earlier.

The guidelines contained in this Code extend with equal force to the personal and professional social media activities of all Business Insider employees.

Our employees may not, under their own names or Business Insider’s name, create, publish, republish or endorse social media postings that include discriminatory remarks, that harass, threaten violence, contain obscene or misleading content, violate any third-party rights, or act to promote any unaffiliated corporate entity. Furthermore, our employees may not publish public-facing content disparaging Business Insider, our affiliates, our advertisers or our employees. Editorial employees must also refrain from sharing partisan content under their social media handles and must be careful to avoid creating the impression of affiliation with individuals or groups that regularly post partisan content. Our employees may not share information that they have reason to believe is confidential or proprietary. Our employees are also not permitted to access social media with the intent of acquiring, without permission, information they have reason to believe is confidential or proprietary. Business Insider strongly encourages our editorial employees to prominently display a disclaimer on their personal social media accounts clarifying that the posts on the account reflect the employee’s personal opinions and are not the views of Business Insider. However, the inclusion of that disclaimer will not necessarily inure the employee from discipline by Business Insider. Business Insider does not permit its employees to break the law. Ignorance of the law is not exculpatory. Any employee who cannot guarantee their ability to comply with the Code in all respects must consult with Talent as soon as possible.",https://www.businessinsider.com/code-of-ethics

Conflict of Interest Policy,"Last updated: August 27th, 2019 Welcome to the websites, applications and services provided by Business Insider, Inc. (""Business Insider""), which include without limitationwww.businessinsider.com,www.techinsider.io,www.insider.com,markets.businessinsider.com,coupons.businessinsider.com(in partnership with GSG) (the ""Sites""). These guidelines generally apply to all members of our company. Our fundamental purpose is to protect the impartiality and neutrality of Business Insider and the integrity of its news stories. Every staff member is expected to read these rules carefully and to think about how they might apply to his or her duties. Staff members must not disclose confidential information about the operations, policies or plans of our company. Journalists who regularly cover business and financial news may not play the market: that is, they may not conduct in-and-out trading, speculate in options or futures or sell securities short. Any of these actions could create an appearance of exploiting information not available to the public. Staff members who regularly cover business aspects of technology or other subjects are also subject to this rule. All Business Insider employees are expected to conduct themselves at all times in a manner that leaves no grounds for belief, or even suspicion that: An employee, an employee's family, or anyone else connected to an employee made financial gains by acting on the basis of ""inside"" information obtained through Business Insider employment before that information was available to the general public. The creation or dissemination, or non-dissemination, of any news or other information was influenced by a desire to affect the price of any security; An employee's personal financial situation with respect to investments is such that it creates a temptation to violate these rules; or An employee is beholden to news-makers, information providers, advertisers or market participants, creating a temptation to violate these rules. In making personal investments, all employees must avoid speculation or the appearance of speculation. No employee of Business Insider may engage in the short selling of securities. In addition, all senior managers and all news and advertising personnel must not engage in short-term trading of equity securities or of non-investment grade fixed-income securities; such employees must hold such a securities for a minimum of six month unless, in order to meet some special need, they get prior permission for an earlier sale from the Company. The six-month rule does not apply to publicly-available diversified open end and closed end mutual funds. News and advertising personnel and members of senior management with any responsibility for news or advertising also must not buy or sell futures or options. However, these employees may invest in equity index-related products and publicly available mutual funds or commodity pools that invest in futures or options. No news or advertising personnel assigned to report or call on a specific industry may buy or sell securities in any company engaged, in whole or significant part, in that industry, nor may any member of the immediate family of any employee do so. It is unacceptable for anyone at Business Insider to accept cash or anything else of value in exchange for promotion/links, etc. in a story, especially if the relationship isn't disclosed. There are certain instances in which we are given travel expenses or swag or other benefits for covering a story. And, importantly, when we are given these things, we should always disclose it clearly. There are also certain instances in which our company might be paid to link to sponsors' sites, but those relationships will also be disclosed clearly. With approval, staff members may accept freelance assignments that do not directly compete with Business Insider's offerings. Normally, work for competitors will not be permitted. In rare instances, permission may be granted when supervisory editors are not interested in the article or project offered by a staff member. Also with approval, staff members may participate in radio, television or online interviews or discussions, local or national, that deal with articles they have written or subjects that figure in coverage they provide, prepare or supervise. Such occasional appearances must not imply that the journalist speaks for our organization. Staff members should ensure that the use of their names and company affiliation is consistent with the Sites's impartiality. Staff members must ensure that their freelance work does not interfere with their normal responsibilities. Staff members who borrow equipment, vehicles or other goods for evaluation or review must return them as soon as possible. Staff members may keep for their own collections -- but may not sell or copy -- books sent to them for review. Such submissions are considered press releases. Any staff member intending to write a non-fiction book based on material that derives from his or her assignment or beat must notify newsroom management in advance. If the plan is to reproduce content created for any of our media, Business Insider owns that material outright. It is not Business Insider's intention to dissuade employees from participating actively in civic, charitable, religious, public, social or residential organizations. Such activities are permitted, and even encouraged, to the extent that they: Do not detract from performance or effectiveness of work; Do not cause Business Insider to appear to subsidize the activity; Do not otherwise violate this code. Business Insider as a publisher does not participate in the partisan political process on any governmental levels. Business Insider does not contribute (directly or indirectly) to political campaigns, parties, or groups seeking to raise money. Business Insider will not reimburse any employee for their political contributions at any level. All editorial team members and senior management with any responsibility for news should refrain from partisan political activity. As relates to candidates for elected office, this activity includes passing out buttons, posting partisan comments on social-networking sites, blogging, helping to solicit campaign contributions, or hosting a fundraiser for a partisan candidate. This activity also includes making any level of financial contribution to a candidate's campaign for elected office or any Political Action Committee supporting individual candidates for elected office. While these restrictions do not explicitly apply to an employee's spouse, significant other, children, or family members, all editorial team members and senior management with any responsibility for news should refrain from exhibiting political bias. Business Insider takes this code of conduct very seriously. All employees of Business Insider are responsible for compliance with all aspects of this code. All new employees shall be required to read this code at the outset of their employment, and to attest in writing that they have done so; all Business Insider employees shall be required, at the time this code is first promulgated, to read it and so attest. Such written attestations shall be required once each year. The matters addressed by this code are sufficiently important that any lapse in judgment within the areas covered here may be considered serious enough to warrant discipline up to and including dismissal. Any employee who has a question about or becomes aware of his or her own possible violation of this code or by any other employee, or becomes aware that he or another employee is involved in a transaction or relationship that could reasonably give rise to an actual or apparent conflict of interest, should promptly discuss the situation with his or her supervisor. Every effort will be made to maintain the confidentiality of such discussions. Business Insider will not permit or tolerate any retaliation against any employee who makes a good faith report about a possible violation of the code by another employee. Indeed, the most important wisdom about dealing with these questions is: When in doubt, ask.",https://www.businessinsider.com/conflict-of-interest-policy

For this purpose, we create pseudonymised usage profiles. These usage profiles help us to better understand your needs and preferences, so we can provide you with individual and interest-based contents and promotional offers. Pseudonymous usage profiles do not allow us to draw any conclusions as to your identity, and we do not combine user profiles with data that directly identifies you (e.g., email address), unless you have explicitly allowed us to do so. 3.11 To prevent fraud or potentially illegal activities (including, without limitation, copyright infringement) on or through the Website. We work with various third-party vendors to provide services through the Website to improve the user experience, to better understand how users interact with the Website, and to help provide our users content and advertising that reflects their interests. If you sign-up for our loyalty rewards program, we may share your information with technical third party service providers with which we have entered into a contractual relationship to assist with the administration of the program. These service providers may process your email address and other personal data on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions, including to help us issuing the Rewards. Our service providers are prohibited from using this information to contact you on their behalf or to disclose the information to third parties, except as necessary to perform services on our behalf.

In order to be paid our commissions, we may receive information from our business partners (e.g., merchants) about online purchases made after visiting this Website, including purchases on websites of third parties (e.g., online-shops). Information about online purchases is transmitted to us automatically with the help of tracking cookies. We only receive commission-related information such as the value of your purchase and date and time of the transaction. We also work with several so-called affiliate networks (“Affiliate Networks”), which connect us with merchants and take over the technical and billing process. In these cases, we receive the respective information from such Affiliate Networks. We solely use this information for billing purposes. 4.5 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Tags and Scripts We may use various tracking technologies to collect and process Automatically Collected Technical Data described in Section 2 of the Policy. The tracking tools we use may include cookies, Web beacons (also known as Pixel-Tags, tracking pixels, or clear GIFs), tags and scripts, and other similar technologies including local storage objects such as HTML5. When we collect information this way, we use it to better understand how Website Visitors are using the site. When you click on a promotional offer, we may assign a unique identifier to the click (“Clickout-ID”). We provide this Clickout-ID to the respective business partner, on whose behalf the promotional offer is displayed. If you subsequently register or purchase something from that business partner (e.g., in an online-shop), the business partner can use the Clickout-ID to attribute the purchase to our Website. That is how we will earn our commission. We also work with several Affiliate Networks, which connect us with merchants and handle the technical and billing process. In these cases, we pass on the Clickout-ID to such Affiliate Networks. These Affiliate Networks may set their own tracking cookies when you visit our Website and click on an offer.

Cookies:Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device by your browser while you are visiting a website. Usually a cookie contains the website’s name using it and a string of text or a “unique identifier” which enables websites to recognize that cookie on each subsequent visit throughout its lifetime. Cookies can collect and store a wide range of information, such as the type of browser or operating system used, language or other browser settings, or your interaction with the website. Usually cookies are not used to collect data that itself identifies an individual. However, information collected with cookies may become associated with a natural person, if it is combined with personal information. Some cookies (calledsession cookies) erase their records about you when you close your browser. Other cookies (calledpersistentcookies) erase their records about you at some preset time, regardless of whether you close your browser. We may use both types of cookies, whether we place them directly on the site, or whether third-parties place them on the site for us. The data from these cookies is then used to enable features on the site and to help us better understand how users experience the Website. Apart from cookies, we also use other tracking technologies. Web beacons, embedded scripts and other similar technologies:We and our third-party partners may also use similar technologies on this Website, such as web beacons (also called Pixel-Tags, tracking pixels, clear GIFs) or scripts. Web Beacons are small graphic images (that may be embedded into websites or in HTML emails), which are usually not visible for the Website Visitor. They track the Website Visitor’s interaction with this Website or the services our vendors help us provide.

The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Website, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies by your browser settings, they typically work in conjunction with cookies; accordingly, declining cookies in your browser will, in most cases, impair functioning of these technologies as well.

About Us,"Our journey began in 2007 when we burst onto the scene as Silicon Alley Insider. Two years later, we adopted the name Business Insider. We were trailblazers, breaking the real story of Facebook's founding, demystifying the 2008 financial crisis for our readers, and profiling the visionaries who built some of today's largest tech companies. We covered the startups and people our audience cared about, even if we occasionally ruffled some feathers. We showed the world that business journalism could be visual and fun. Over time we grew into a global news organization, with journalists from New York to Singapore. We moved headquarters from a loading dock into a real office in the Financial District. We built a video team. We embraced social distribution and platforms. Our stories have changed government policies, gotten executives fired, launched investigations, and reopened closed cases. We turned small businesses into overnight sensations. We coined terms like ""quiet quitting"" that entered the zeitgeist. We tried lots of things — some ideas worked, others didn't. We won our first Pulitzer Prize. Nearly two decades later, the core of who we are hasn't changed.

If a dispute arises between you and Business Insider with respect to your use of the Sites and/or any online products or services owned, controlled or offered by Business Insider that post a link to and are governed by these Terms of Service (collectively, the ""Services""), both parties agree that they will first, as a prerequisite to the below, make a good faith effort to resolve the dispute informally for 60 days after the responding party's receipt of a written description of the dispute from the claimant party. The written description must be on an individual basis and provide your name, a description of the nature and basis of the claim, and the specific relief sought. Any relevant limitations period, filing fees, or other deadlines will be tolled during the 60 days. (i) If the informal dispute resolution does not resolve all claims and disputes that in any way relate to a dispute with Business Insider pursuant to, or that may arise out of the interpretation, applicability, performance, or enforcement of, these Terms of Service (including this section 17) (collectively, ""Claims"") shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration according to this section 17 (the ""Arbitration Agreement""). ""Claims"" includes any (A) claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this Arbitration Agreement and/or arising after its termination pursuant to 17(g) and 17(h) below, (B) claims arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Service and this Arbitration Agreement, or that all or any part thereof are void or voidable or whether the claim is subject to arbitration, and (C) disputes regarding the payment of administrative or arbitrator fees (including payment timing and nonpayment remedies). This Arbitration Agreement is exclusively governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (""FAA"") in all respects and evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Except as otherwise set forth in this clause 17(b), the arbitrator or arbitration body shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes. (ii) The arbitrator or arbitration body shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. Notwithstanding this clause 17(b), each party retains the right to (A) elect to have applicable claims resolved in small claims court on an individual basis; (B) bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (meaning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary information, but not privacy or publicity rights); and (C) seek a declaratory judgment, injunction, or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party's Claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court.

(iv) Except as set forth in clause 17(c) below, if any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be invalid, the parties agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in that provision, and that the other provisions hereof remain in full force and effect. (v) THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT ARBITRATION MEANS THAT AN ARBITRATOR AND NOT A JUDGE OR JURY WILL DECIDE CLAIMS, AND THAT RIGHTS TO PREHEARING EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION AND APPEALS MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND BUSINESS INSIDER ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. c.Class Arbitration & Collective Relief Waiver. YOU AND BUSINESS INSIDER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, EXCEPT AS SET OUT OTHERWISE IN THIS CLAUSE 17(c) AND CLAUSE 17(e) BELOW, ANY ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY ONLY AND NOT AS A CLASS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO RESOLVE AN INDIVIDUAL PARTY'S CLAIM. NOTWITHSTANDING THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION INVOLVING YOU MAY PROCEED ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, THOUGH IT MAY DO SO ONLY IF BUSINESS INSIDER CONSENTS TO CONSOLIDATE IN WRITING. d.Arbitration Rules, Initiation, Location & Procedure. If available, the arbitration will be administered by the National Arbitration and Mediation (""NAM"") and resolved before a single arbitrator. In no event shall any arbitration be administered by the American Arbitration Association (""AAA""). Except as modified by this section 17, NAM will administer the arbitration according to applicable NAM rules and procedures available atwww.namadr.comor by emailing NAM's Commercial Dept atcommercial@namadr.com. If you are initiating arbitration, a copy of the demand shall also be emailed tolegal@businessinsider.com. If Business Insider is initiating arbitration, it will serve a copy of the demand to the email address associated with your Business Insider account. Subject to NAM rules and procedures, the arbitrator will have discretion to allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute. Unless prohibited by law, all arbitration proceedings will be confidential and closed to the public and any parties other than you and Business Insider (and each party's authorized representatives and agents), and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed to the extent permitted by law. e.Batch Arbitration. If 100 or more similar arbitration demands (asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted to NAM (or another non-AAA arbitration provider selected if NAM is unavailable) against Business Insider within reasonably close proximity (""Mass Filing""), the parties agree (i) to administer the Mass Filing in batches of 100 demands per batch (a final batch may consist of the remaining demands if less than 100) with only one batch filed, processed, and adjudicated at a time; (ii) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; (iii) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined in the arbitrator's discretion; (iv) that no other arbitration demands that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the prior batch of 100 is filed, processed, and adjudicated; (v) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by Business Insider and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a set of batch proceedings and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; and (vi) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each set including 100 demands, shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved. Arbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted to the greatest extent possible according to applicable NAM rules and procedures, and the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings will be conducted.You agree to cooperate in good faith with Business Insider and the arbitration provider to implement such a ""batch approach"" or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims.Any disagreement between the parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator appointed by NAM. This ""Batch Arbitration"" provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM's Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Unless Business Insider otherwise consents in writing, Business Insider does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in clause 13(c) above and this clause 13(g). If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled. f.Arbitrator's Decision, Fees. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant, on an individual basis, any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual to the extent available under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and this Arbitration Agreement. The parties agree that the damages and/or other relief must be consistent with clause 13(c) above and also must be consistent with the terms of the ""Limitation of Liability"" section 16 above as damages or other relief for which Business Insider may be held liable. No arbitration award or decision will be preclusive of issues or claims in any dispute with persons not a named party to the arbitration. Attorneys' fees will be available to the prevailing party only if authorized under the substantive law governing the claims. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions according to NAM rules and procedures for any frivolous claims or submissions the arbitrator determines were not filed in good faith, and for a party's failure to comply with the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure in clause 17(a). You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise. g.Right to Opt-Out of the Arbitration Agreement.

The written description must be on an individual basis and provide your name, a description of the nature and basis of the claim, and the specific relief sought. Any relevant limitations period, filing fees, or other deadlines will be tolled during the 60 days. (i) If the informal dispute resolution does not resolve all claims and disputes that in any way relate to a dispute with Business Insider pursuant to, or that may arise out of the interpretation, applicability, performance, or enforcement of, these Terms of Service (including this section 17) (collectively, ""Claims"") shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration according to this section 17 (the ""Arbitration Agreement"").

This Arbitration Agreement is exclusively governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (""FAA"") in all respects and evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Except as otherwise set forth in this clause 17(b), the arbitrator or arbitration body shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes. (ii) The arbitrator or arbitration body shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. Notwithstanding this clause 17(b), each party retains the right to (A) elect to have applicable claims resolved in small claims court on an individual basis; (B) bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (meaning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary information, but not privacy or publicity rights); and (C) seek a declaratory judgment, injunction, or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party's Claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court.

(v) THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT ARBITRATION MEANS THAT AN ARBITRATOR AND NOT A JUDGE OR JURY WILL DECIDE CLAIMS, AND THAT RIGHTS TO PREHEARING EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION AND APPEALS MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND BUSINESS INSIDER ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. c.Class Arbitration & Collective Relief Waiver. YOU AND BUSINESS INSIDER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, EXCEPT AS SET OUT OTHERWISE IN THIS CLAUSE 17(c) AND CLAUSE 17(e) BELOW, ANY ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY ONLY AND NOT AS A CLASS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO RESOLVE AN INDIVIDUAL PARTY'S CLAIM. NOTWITHSTANDING THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION INVOLVING YOU MAY PROCEED ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, THOUGH IT MAY DO SO ONLY IF BUSINESS INSIDER CONSENTS TO CONSOLIDATE IN WRITING. d.Arbitration Rules, Initiation, Location & Procedure. If available, the arbitration will be administered by the National Arbitration and Mediation (""NAM"") and resolved before a single arbitrator. In no event shall any arbitration be administered by the American Arbitration Association (""AAA""). Except as modified by this section 17, NAM will administer the arbitration according to applicable NAM rules and procedures available atwww.namadr.comor by emailing NAM's Commercial Dept atcommercial@namadr.com. If you are initiating arbitration, a copy of the demand shall also be emailed tolegal@businessinsider.com. If Business Insider is initiating arbitration, it will serve a copy of the demand to the email address associated with your Business Insider account. Subject to NAM rules and procedures, the arbitrator will have discretion to allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute. Unless prohibited by law, all arbitration proceedings will be confidential and closed to the public and any parties other than you and Business Insider (and each party's authorized representatives and agents), and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed to the extent permitted by law. e.Batch Arbitration. If 100 or more similar arbitration demands (asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted to NAM (or another non-AAA arbitration provider selected if NAM is unavailable) against Business Insider within reasonably close proximity (""Mass Filing""), the parties agree (i) to administer the Mass Filing in batches of 100 demands per batch (a final batch may consist of the remaining demands if less than 100) with only one batch filed, processed, and adjudicated at a time; (ii) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; (iii) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined in the arbitrator's discretion; (iv) that no other arbitration demands that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the prior batch of 100 is filed, processed, and adjudicated; (v) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by Business Insider and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a set of batch proceedings and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; and (vi) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each set including 100 demands, shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved. Arbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted to the greatest extent possible according to applicable NAM rules and procedures, and the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings will be conducted.You agree to cooperate in good faith with Business Insider and the arbitration provider to implement such a ""batch approach"" or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims.Any disagreement between the parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator appointed by NAM. This ""Batch Arbitration"" provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM's Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Unless Business Insider otherwise consents in writing, Business Insider does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in clause 13(c) above and this clause 13(g). If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled. f.Arbitrator's Decision, Fees. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant, on an individual basis, any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual to the extent available under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and this Arbitration Agreement. The parties agree that the damages and/or other relief must be consistent with clause 13(c) above and also must be consistent with the terms of the ""Limitation of Liability"" section 16 above as damages or other relief for which Business Insider may be held liable. No arbitration award or decision will be preclusive of issues or claims in any dispute with persons not a named party to the arbitration. Attorneys' fees will be available to the prevailing party only if authorized under the substantive law governing the claims. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions according to NAM rules and procedures for any frivolous claims or submissions the arbitrator determines were not filed in good faith, and for a party's failure to comply with the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure in clause 17(a). You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise. g.Right to Opt-Out of the Arbitration Agreement.

We engage companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf (e.g., software maintenance services, cloud storage, chatbot providers, order fulfillment, e-mail services, delivery services, database management, analytics, credit referencing, payment processing, and other services) (“Service Providers”). We may disclose some of the information we collect from or about you to our Service Providers, such as information collected automatically from devices you use to connect to our Service. This may include usage and technical information about how users interact with our Service, including activity data such as where you go on our website, how you use different website features, links you click on, and similar information. We may also disclose some of the information that we collect from or about you with other parties in order to process and fulfill your requests for video content offered through our Service, including to provide you with access to localized content and video content recommendations.

We may provide personal information to third parties, such as advertising partners or other marketing partners who provide services to us. Some features of our Service may enable you to post content to social networking services (“SNSs”). If you choose to do this, we will provide information to such SNSs in accordance with your elections. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of those websites and that it is your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policy of the third party provider of such SNSs. We will not be responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such SNSs; (ii) the content, products or services on or availability of such SNSs; or (iii) your use of any such SNSs. Please refer to the “Social Media Services and Technology Integrations” section for more information on the use of Social Media. We may also disclose your personal information to our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or Company Affiliates. We may disclose your personal information to our clients in connection with us processing your personal information on their behalf. For example, if you subscribe to our newsletters and promotional communications, Business Insider or EMARKETER may send you content on behalf of their clients and disclose your personal information to such clients for their own marketing purposes. We may disclose your personal information to our business partners in connection with offering you co-branded services, selling or distributing our products, or engaging in joint marketing activities. In addition, if you choose to participate in certain of our programs or to receive certain content we make available (e.g., webinar programs), we may disclose your information to participating sponsors, content providers, and related vendors in connection with such programs and content. We may disclose your personal information to facilitate your requests such as when you choose to disclose information to a social network about your activities on the Service or participate in a business partner’s program. In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments (""Payment Service""). If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment using a Payment Service, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service’s use of information collected through any Payment Service. If you purchase one of our services, we and/or Payment Service provider(s) may use payment information to help provide the service you purchased. For example, payment information may be used to retrieve account information for a subscriber, to determine whether a subscriber is eligible for promotions, and to detect abuse of our services. In addition, for your convenience, we or our Payment Service provider(s) may enable your payment information to be accessible between Business Insider and EMARKETER in order to process your transaction more efficiently. We may disclose personal information to vendors and other parties, for business and commercial purposes, including analytics and advertising technology companies that measure and improve our service, advertising effectiveness, and enable other enhancements on our website. Vendors or such other parties may act as our Service Providers, or in certain contexts, independently decide how to process your information. For more information on practices related to advertising and analytics, see the “Analytics and Advertising Technology” section below. We reserve the right to disclose your information to respond to valid information requests from government authorities and judicial requests, to investigate potential fraud, or where otherwise required by law. We may disclose your personal information where we believe the disclosure is necessary or appropriate to comply with regulatory or legal requirements, or to protect the safety, rights, or property of ourselves and others and to exercise, establish, or defend our legal rights. Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, we may sell, transfer or otherwise disclose some or all of our assets, including your personal information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. We may disclose your personal information at your direction or with your consent. We may disclose personal information with the general public if you choose to disclose personal information when contributing content to our Service through forums, blogs, social features, or the like. Without limiting the foregoing, in our sole discretion, we may disclose information, including aggregate data which does not identify you and/or deidentified personal information, to third parties or affiliates for any purpose except as prohibited by applicable law. To the extent we process deidentified personal information, as defined under applicable law, we will maintain and use that information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information except as permitted by applicable law. Our Service contains links to, or content from, other parties' websites, products and services. The fact that we link to a website or display an advertisement or other parties' content is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with any of those other parties, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over other parties’ websites, products or services, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. These other products and services may place their own cookies or other technologies on your computer or other device, collect data, or solicit information from you while you are exploring their websites, products, or services. Other persons and entities follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the information you submit to them or they collect from you. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those other parties. We may offer blogs, social media profiles, message boards, bulletin boards, or similar public forums where you and other users of our Service can post content or otherwise communicate. If you post personal information on a public forum, we will assume you intend to make that personal information public. We may use your name to identify you with a posting in a public forum and may use your post on or in connection with our Service (e.g., when using a hashtag associated with Business Insider in a tweet or status update). Any personal information you disclose in a public forum is public information and may be seen or collected by other persons, including third parties that do not adhere to the standards set forth in this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for events that may arise from the distribution of any information you choose to publicly post or share through our online services. In addition, to the extent you interact with social networks or other services through the Service (such as “liking” or “sharing” our content or otherwise connecting our Service to a social network), information collected and stored by those other parties through your interaction or pages that contain their tracking technologies remains subject to their policies and practices, including whether they disclose information about you to us, the types of information disclosed, and your choices on what is visible to others. We are not responsible for and make no representations regarding the policies or business practices of any other parties or their services and encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. Our Service may contain tracking technologies owned and operated by other parties. For example, we use tracking technologies from analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to help us understand how users access and use the Service. Our app does not use these technologies for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes. We may also work with ad networks, advertisers, agencies, and other technology services to place advertisements on our website and/or other websites and services. These parties may set and access cookies and other technologies on your personal computer and/or device and track certain behavioral information regarding users of your personal computer and/or device. As noted above, these website cookies and other technologies are set to, among other things: (a) track your activities across time and services for purposes of measuring conversions or actions you take, associating different devices you use, and serving ads and/or other content targeted to your interests (“Interest-based Advertising”); (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. We may also use audience matching services (which is a type of Interest-Based Advertising) to reach people (or similar audiences) who have visited our website or are identified in one or more of our databases. For example, we may disclose hashed email addresses to an ad partner to determine if there are common matching factors between our data and their data in order to serve you more personalized ads. As discussed above, vendors and ad partners may act as our Service Providers, or in certain contexts, independently decide how to process your information. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. For further information on your choices regarding these third party tracking technologies, please see the section entitled “Your Advertising Choices” below. Cookies and location-identifying technologies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your device. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies some parts of the Service may not work and that when you revisit the Service your ability to limit browser-based tracking technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations. Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals or other mechanisms. We do, however, respond to global privacy preferences when required by law. You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going tohttps://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptoutand downloading the Google Analytics Opt Out Browser Add-on. Some of the advertisers and vendors that perform advertising-related services for us and our partners participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visithttp://www.aboutads.info/choices, andhttp://www.aboutads.info/appchoicesfor information on the DAA’s opt out program for mobile applications. Some of these companies are also members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt out options for their members, see http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Business Insider is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third parties’ opt out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. Additionally, we may collaborate with our service providers and identity partners (""Identity Resolution Partners"") to deliver targeted advertising and identify the different devices and browsers you may use to access our Services. We and our Identity Resolution Partners may facilitate identity resolution by creating probabilistic and deterministic identifiers. These identifiers may use personal information, including your name, email address, phone number, and Activity Information to generate an online identifier reasonably linkable to you and/or your device or browser. For example, we may disclose hashed email address, phone number, or other information about your device to our Identity Resolution Partners, whom may, in turn, return an online identifier that we may store in a first party cookie or similar technology and disclose to our advertising partners to provide you a more personalized advertising experience. These identifiers also help us with fraud detection and security, enforce our Terms of Service, among other things. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our Identity Resolution Partners, which are separate from our own and not covered by this Privacy Policy. You may have additional rights related to these technologies depending on your state of residency, as outlined in Section 12 below. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, please follow any unsubscribe instructions provided in our communications to you, update your user preferences via our subscription management tools on our Service, or contact us as set forth in the section below entitled “Contact Us”, and specify your request. Please note that you cannot opt out of non-promotional e-mails, and we may use your information to contact you with important notifications, such as notices with respect to purchases, safety, or changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Also, your unsubscribe is limited to the e-mail address or phone number used for that particular subscription and will not affect subsequent subscriptions. Residents of Applicable States (as defined above), the European Economic Area, and the United Kingdom, have specific rights with respect to our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. Please review our location-specific sections below for more information about those rights. We employ appropriate security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and are not responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information. If you suspect unauthorized use of personal information that you have provided us – such as your account information or its credentials – you should notify us immediately using the information in the Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy. We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law. Remember that even after you cancel your account, or if you ask us to delete your personal information, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared information with social media or other services. Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others. We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancellation or your request for deletion, for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security or recordkeeping policies. It may not always be possible to completely remove or delete all of your information due to technical constraints or contractual, financial or legal requirements. Our Services are hosted in and managed from the United States. If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information processed in the United States or in any other country in which we have facilities or in which we engage service providers. The United States and other countries’ data protection laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in the United States may be entitled to access your personal information. To the extent that the Company offers products and services to individuals located in the European Economic Area or United Kingdom, or to the extent the Service is deliberately made available to such individuals, please review the section titled “Additional Disclosures for Data Subjects in Europe and United Kingdom” below for more information about disclosures and privacy rights associated with that activity.

Our California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) metrics for the previous calendar year are as follows: Number of requests to delete that were received, complied with in whole or in part, and denied: 623 Number of requests to correct that were received, complied with in whole or in part, and denied: 2 Number of requests to opt out of sale/sharing that were received, complied with in whole or in part, and denied: 89 The median or mean number of days it took to substantively respond (i.e not the 10 day “confirmation of receipt” window); 15.50 days Customers who are residents of California may request (i) a list of the categories of personal information disclosed by us to third parties during the immediately preceding calendar year for those third parties’ own direct marketing purposes; and (ii) a list of the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed such information. To exercise a request, please write us at the email or postal address set out in “Contact Us” section above and specify that you are making a “California Shine the Light Request.” We may require additional information from you to allow us to verify your identity and are only required to respond to requests once during any calendar year. This section applies to any individuals located within the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, or any jurisdiction to which similar privacy laws apply, from whom we may have collected personal data from any source, including through your use of our Services.  We provide this Notice to comply with applicable privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Act (“GDPR”), the UK GDPR, and related laws, regulations, and guidance from the European Union and/or its member states.  Any capitalized term used and not otherwise defined below has the meaning assigned to it in our Privacy Policy. For the purposes of this Notice, “personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. EU and UK data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “data controllers”) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as “data processors”). Both Business Insider and EMARKETER may act as either a data controller or a data processor in respect of your personal data, depending on the circumstances. We generally act as data controller with respect to information you provide through the Service. Sometimes we operate as a data processor on behalf of a client, a separate legal entity, which is the data controller. For example, if you subscribe to our newsletters and promotional communications, we may send you content on behalf of our clients and share your personal data with our clients for their own marketing purposes. Please visit the applicable client’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. Any questions that you may have relating to such personal data and your rights under data protection law should therefore be directed to the client as the data controller, not to Business Insider or EMARKETER. We rely on one or more legal bases to process your personal data under applicable law.  We may process personal data (i) as necessary to perform our contractual obligations to you, including, but not limited to, those obligations in our terms of use; (ii) as necessary to pursue our legitimate interests as further detailed below; (iii) as necessary for our compliance with our legal obligations such as a request or order from courts, law enforcement or other government authorities; and/or (iv) with your consent, including to send you marketing email messages and other information that may be of interest to you, which you may withdraw at any time. We may collect, process, and maintain personal data to pursue the legitimate business interests outlined below.  To determine these legitimate interests, we balance our legitimate interests against the legitimate interests and rights of you and others and only process personal data in accordance with those interests where they are not overridden by your data-protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. While our legitimate interests are most extensively detailed in Section 3 of this Privacy Policy, they generally include: Provide, improve, and develop our Service, including to deliver your requested Services, send you messages and provide user support, customize the Services to better fit your needs as a user, develop new Services, and perform internal analytics and research and development. This also includes sharing personal data with our trusted service providers that provide services on our behalf. Protect you and others and to create and maintain a trusted environment, such as to comply with our legal obligations, to ensure compliance our agreements with you and other third parties, to ensure safe, secure, and reliable Services, and to detect and prevent wrongdoing and crime, assure compliance with our policies, and protect and defend our rights, interests, and property. In connection with the activities above, we may conduct internal research and profiling based on your interactions on various Sites, content you submit to the Sites, and information obtained from third parties. Provide, personalize, measure and improve our marketing, including to send you promotional messages and other information that may be of interest to you with your consent. We may also use personal data to understand our user base and the effectiveness of our marketing.
