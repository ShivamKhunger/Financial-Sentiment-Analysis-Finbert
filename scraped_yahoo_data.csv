"Not just condos: Florida’s housing market is softening, especially along the southwest coast","Florida’s pandemic-era housing boom is finally starting to fade. For-sale inventory in the state has reached the highest levels on record, and homes are staying on the market longer even as peak homebuying season kicks off. In many parts of the state, prices are starting to fall. The turning market comes as migration to the Sunshine State slows, and a combination of hurricane fears, rising insurance and tax bills, and a steady supply of new construction has given buyers more leverage. While the state’s condo market has been in correction ever since new building laws took effect in the aftermath of the 2021 condo collapse in Surfside, Fla., the market for single-family homes is also starting to soften. “Inventory and time on market has been dramatically increasing,” said Ben Grieco, a real estate agent in the southwestern city of Port Charlotte. “It’s not like buyers have left by any means, but there’s just so much to choose from that it’s really pushing prices down.” Listings across the state usurped pre-pandemic levels in January, according to Realtor.com. As of last month, there were more than 168,000 homes active on the market. Residences in Florida spent an average of 75 days on the market, up 13 days from a year earlier, according to Redfin. As of January, single-family home prices were falling the fastest in a cluster of cities on the southern Gulf Coast. Prices in Punta Gorda are down nearly 8% since January 2024, according to Zillow data. Thirty miles south, in Cape Coral, home prices have dropped 5.6% year over year. Prices in North Port and the high-end, golf-focused city of Naples have also fallen by more than 3% in the last year. ‘People are worried’ Memories of Hurricane Ian, which devastated a number of southwest Florida communities in 2022 and was the costliest storm in the state’s history, still loom large with today’s buyers and sellers, said Rick Harrison, a Fort Myers-based real estate agent. Buyers are asking detailed questions about homes’ flooding history, while sellers are motivated to complete transactions before the next hurricane season starts in June. “Everybody at this point has been educated enough to know that hurricanes had a huge impact on our area,” Harrison said. “On both sides, people are worried.” Yet even as prices fall, many buyers are struggling to afford what’s available for sale. The median listing price in the state is $435,000. It’s been drifting lower since mid-2022 but is still 32% higher than at the end of 2019. The prices, coupled with mortgage rates above 6%, have left many would-be buyers shut out of the market entirely, contributing to the inventory glut. But buyers who can afford it are finding themselves with plenty of leverage. In cooler markets, agents say that offers $20,000 below asking price will often be accepted, and sellers are willing to make any repairs that come up during inspection. Contingencies that were frequently waived during the boom years, like the buyer successfully selling their current home, are also back. There are deals to be found in new construction too, after several years of aggressive development have left many builders sitting on unsold homes. Builders are often willing to buy down mortgage rates to below 5%, cover closing costs, and offer credits toward upgrades. Some are cutting prices on homes entirely, something they typically avoid doing because it hurts existing owners in their communities. Buyer incentives abound Harrison said he’s pointing many buyers toward new construction for the incentives, and the fact that the newest buildings are subject to stricter building codes to guard against hurricane damage. Olivia Wadden and her husband had long dreamed of relocating from Iowa to Florida, where they both have family. “I do not want to be in Iowa, looking at cornfields every day,” said Wadden, 27. “I want the warm weather and the beach, and there’s a lot more opportunity down here.” After spending two years casually scoping out the market around Bradenton, about 50 miles south of Tampa, they jumped in earlier this year when they noticed prices beginning to fall. Their below-list price offer of $289,000 on a three-bedroom new construction townhome was accepted, and they received a slew of other incentives, including a mortgage rate buy-down, a closing cost credit, and upgraded storm windows.

We finally found the one that fit our family.” Florida is still among the top relocation destinations nationwide, but the number of people moving each year has been trending down. The Sunshine State added a net 64,000 people from elsewhere in the country last year, down from more than 100,000 who moved in 2023 and over 300,000 in 2022, according to Census Bureau data. In some cities, home prices are still rising. Statewide, homes are selling for about 1% more than they were a year ago, with metro areas including Miami, Tallahassee, and Gainesville seeing gains. In the Tampa Bay area, real estate agent Sam Brown Perez says she’s noticed buyers picking up some power in recent months, but competition for well-priced homes, especially those closer to city centers, can still be stiff. “The market is now correcting,” Brown Perez said. “We’re not seeing an overcorrection, but it’s starting to level out again.” Claire Boston is a Senior Reporter for Yahoo Finance covering housing, mortgages, and home insurance.

US tariff spat fuels trading boom on Canada’s top exchange,"(Bloomberg) — The early salvos in a North American trade war have been a boon to the operator of Canada’s largest derivatives exchange. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump DEI Purge Hits Affordable Housing Groups Electric Construction Equipment Promises a Quiet Revolution How Britain’s Most Bike-Friendly New Town Got Built Open Philanthropy Launches $120 Million Fund To Support YIMBY Reforms The Dark Prophet of Car-Clogged Cities Investors are navigating the geopolitical jitters by flocking to financial products that feed off the uncertainty, with exchanges like Toronto-based TMX Group Inc. riding the wave. Trading volumes are “off the charts” in rates futures and options on exchange-traded funds, Luc Fortin, global head of trading at TMX Group, said on March 10 at the Futures Industry Association conference in Boca Raton, Florida. Stocks across the world have swung wildly as trade-war anxiety has mounted, but in Canada, where the brunt of many of US President Donald Trump’s most caustic barbs and threats have been, the gyrations are particularly pronounced. A gauge of 20-day volatility in the nation’s benchmark index spiked to the highest level since 2022 on Friday, creating a spillover effect into the options markets. By comparison, recent price fluctuations in major developed markets’ indexes have been in line with their long-term trend, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Like its bigger US rivals CME Group Inc. and Intercontinental Exchange Inc., TMX Group gives traders a myriad of ways to hedge or speculate on price movements across different asset classes. Rising volatility has played in favor of shares of TMX Group. The stock is up 13% so far this year, bucking a 0.7% decline in the broader S&P/TSX Composite Index. “TMX is well positioned for the evolving environment,” said Scotiabank analyst Phil Hardie in a note, referring to its recurring and transactional revenue mix. “What makes it unique among other Canadian Financial Services companies is its ability to outperform through periods of market volatility.” In February, transaction volumes on TMX’s Montreal Exchange were up by 35% from the same time last year, hitting a record high of over 20.3 million. Overall, TMX Group’s derivatives trading and clearing revenue increased 32% in 2024 to C$94 million, a figure that includes the Boston-based Box Options Exchange in the US. ETF options trading volume on the Montreal Exchange surged 116% in February, compared with the same month last year. On the US options markets, by comparison, volume for such trades was up 10% in the same period, data from the Options Clearing Corporation shows. “We are seeing a significant jump in demand for protection,” James Neals, national director of the structured products team at Desjardins Securities, said. Nevertheless, while market volatility is currently a tailwind for TMX Group, how long the swings will last is anyone’s guess.

Republicans buy up Teslas as Trump urges Maga to back Elon Musk,"Elon Musk’s Tesla is enjoying a sales boost in Maga-backing parts of America as the billionaire’s support for Donald Trump leads to boycotts from Left-wing opponents. Combined Tesla sales in the 31 states that voted for Mr Trump rose at the end of last year, as Mr Musk allied himself with the Republican candidate, according to a state-by-state analysis of sales data by The Telegraph. In contrast, sales fell in the states that supported Kamala Harris, Mr Trump’s Democratic rival. The figures come after Mr Trump sought to boost Mr Musk’s company by promoting the carmaker in front of the White House this week and pledging to purchase his own Tesla. The company has endured a share price crash in recent weeks amid wider market chaos and as sales tumble in many key markets, in part due to a backlash against Mr Musk’s politics. Mr Trump accused “radical Left lunatics” of illegally boycotting the company last week as Tesla’s shares fell below their pre- election level for the first time. The US president urged Americans to buy Mr Musk’s cars, calling Tesla “one of the world’s great automakers”, and said he would have people vandalising Tesla sites as domestic terrorists. He said Mr Musk had been treated “very unfairly”. Sean Hannity, the Fox News presenter, subsequently said on X he had ordered one of the cars. Tesla enjoyed a 6.5pc year-on-year rise across Republican states in the fourth quarter of last year, the period in which Mr Trump won the election and Mr Musk was continually by his side. They fell 12.8pc across Democratic states. Sales rose in 18 of 31 Republican states but only two of 20 Democrat-voting states. The figures include the District of Columbia, which is not classified as a state and voted for Ms Harris in the election. The figures demonstrate Tesla’s growing support among Republican voters at the same time as Mr Musk’s support for Mr Trump ostracises the Democrats that have traditionally been Tesla’s core customer base. Tesla’s have traditionally been favoured by eco-conscious, Left-leaning drivers. Anti-Tesla protests were planned in many cities over the weekend, including in Manchester and London, in a movement called Tesla Takedown opposed to Mr Musk’s Republican activism. The state-by-state sales data, provided by Atlas Public Policy, indicate that sales in Republican states picked up at the end of the year, as Mr Musk’s support for Mr Trump was thrust into the mainstream. Tesla sales had fallen year-on-year in Republican states in each of the previous three quarters. Sales in Democratic states still outnumber those in Republican states, with 88,711 in the final three months of last year compared to 54,872, although the gap is shrinking. Democratic states accounted for 62pc of all sales at the end of last year. Sales in California, America’s biggest electric car market, fell by 10pc at the end of last year. Sales rose by 12pc in Texas, where Tesla moved its headquarters in 2021, and 20pc in Florida, where Mr Trump resided before re-entering the White House. The boost in Trump-supporting states was not enough to account for the drop across Ms Harris’s supporters, with Tesla sales in the US falling 6.3pc in the final quarter of 2024.

How Trump has talked about stock market gyrations since his election win,"In mid-February, President Trump spoke at an investment conference and offered a prediction. ""We're on the verge of soaring markets,"" he told the crowd in Miami that evening. ""I think the stock market is going to be great."" Unfortunately for him and for investors, it turned out to be tough timing. That Feb. 19 speech ended up taking place during the peak of the recent market, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) then beginning a now weeks-long decline. And the selling hasn't abated. Markets are now firmly in correction territory with prices down over 10% this week from the levels on that February evening. That turn in market fortunes has forced Trump into a rapid reorientation of how he has talked about stocks, even as he has also repeatedly said that the long-term gains he sees coming from his tariff agenda will outweigh the current ""turbulence."" But even amid the selling, Trump couldn't resist an occasional foray into his long-held role as a sort of stock pundit-in-chief. Last Tuesday, Trump appeared alongside Elon Musk to buy a Tesla and perhaps prop up that beleaguered stock (TSLA). And he couldn't resist a message to overall investors to buy the dip. ""Some people are going to make great deals by buying stocks and bonds and all the things they are buying,"" he said, adding that ""smart"" businessmen he knows ""are now investing because of what I'm doing because long term what I'm doing is making our country strong again."" During Joe Biden's presidency, Trump's rhetoric on the market often whipsawed dramatically as he tried to explain price increases under a Democratic administration that he had promised would be bad for investors. ""If he's elected,"" Trump said in 2020 while pointing across the debate stage at Biden, ""the stock market will crash."" After his election victory last November, Trump quickly settled into a familiar routine of touting market increases as ones that he was responsible for. On Dec. 22, the then president-elect traveled to Phoenix to note, ""[S]ince the election, the stock market has broken one record after another ... they're calling it the Trump effect because even before taking office, we're already bringing in the jobs and opportunity and safety and common sense back to the USA."" It was a refrain Trump continued for weeks. ""I don't want to say this, it's too braggadocious, but we'll say it anyway: the Trump effect,"" he offered on the eve of his inauguration. And once in office, Trump downplayed initial market fears around tariffs, even at one point feigning ignorance of market moves. ""How is the market doing?"" he asked reporters in early February after signing a batch of executive orders, saying of recent market action, ""I don't think about it."" But then came the sell-off that began on Feb. 19 with Trump again putting forth a range of tactics to deflect the questions that came at increasing velocity from reporters. ""Look, what I have to do is build a strong country,"" he offered in a Fox Business interview taped on March 7. ""You can't really watch the stock market."" Then, on March 12, a day after his appearance with Musk nudging people to buy stocks, Trump returned to an old favorite and blamed the downturn on his predecessor. ""I think a lot of the stock market going down was because of the really bad four years that we had [under Joe Biden],"" he said. Read more: The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs Indeed, Trump and his aides have now taken to offering a series of euphemisms to wave away market troubles — from a ""detox period"" to ""a little turbulence"" to ""growing pains"" — but with the underlying message that Trump clearly thinks the current downturn is an acceptable medicine worth taking in the service of tariffs. Perhaps the most recent signal from Trump came Thursday as he again indicated he is not looking to turn away from his market-rattling tariffs anytime soon. ""We're not going to bend,"" he promised after yet another round of questions about his tariff plans and the market fallout. Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

Credit card debt is getting in the way of saving for many workers nearing retirement,"Overwhelmed by out-of-pocket medical costs, Valerie Towe and her husband, Paul, saw their debt load begin to swell last year. Facing a steady stream of bills for 77-year-old Paul’s chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and neuropathy, Valerie began to tap credit cards to keep up. “I wasn't able to make ends meet,” Valerie, 65, told Yahoo Finance. The cost of weekly groceries added to the strain — nearly doubling last year, she said. And to top it off, as her caregiving duties ramped up, Valerie shifted to a part-time job. “When you're a caregiver, you can't work a full-time job,” she said. The worst of it, as anyone who has rolled over credit card balances month to month knows, is the ballooning debt that accrues when you can only pay the minimum amount of the balance on credit cards that are ladened with interest rates topping 20%. That’s all Valerie has been able to do, and the result is a gut-punching credit card debt nearing $30,000, she said. Nearly half of adults 50 and older who carry credit card debt use credit cards to pay for basic living expenses, according to a new AARP report. And roughly 3 in 10 older adults with credit card debt have more of it than a year ago. More sobering: Nearly half of them owe $5,000 or more, and 28% carry a balance of $10,000 or more. That has serious repercussions for retirement savings. “Many older Americans with credit card debt who hope to retire soon will have to make the difficult decision of whether to pay down debt or save for retirement,” Indira Venkat, senior vice president of research at AARP, told Yahoo Finance. “For those who have already retired and are living on a fixed income, it can be a challenge to both pay down a credit card and make ends meet.” Read more: Best ways to pay off credit card debt She’s right on that one. When people say what they regret the most after they retire, a biggie is retiring with too much debt. In 2024, almost 7 in 10 retirees with debt reported having credit card debt outstanding, per a survey from the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI). That’s up from 4 in 10 four years ago. And while the rising cost of groceries, housing, and vehicles are the byproducts of sticky inflation, one of the biggest culprits of credit card debt is out-of-pocket medical costs such as prescription drugs, which the Towes are grappling with. Dental and vision care add up too, Venkat said. If they could turn the clock back, nearly a quarter of retirees say they would have made paying down credit card and other debts a priority before they exited the workforce, according to a new Fidelity Investments report. The emergence of credit card debt for older Americans is not fading away anytime soon. Roughly 1 in 5 expect to take more than five years to pay it off, per the AARP report. The decision to pay down debt or save for retirement is a reality for many older Americans as they near retirement. More than half of those currently working say that their debt is interfering with their ability to save, a recent report by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies found. Troubling, too, is that the debt has pushed them to tap into existing retirement savings. One in 3 workers has taken a loan, early withdrawal, or hardship withdrawal from their 401(k) or similar plan or IRA, per Transamerica. Among those who have taken out a loan or withdrawn from their 401(k) or similar plan, the most frequently cited reasons are medical bills and paying off credit card debt. More evidence: Last year, hardship withdrawals increased over 2023, with 4.8% of participants tapping their retirement savings, up from 3.6%, according to Vanguard Group, which administers 401(k)-type accounts for nearly 5 million people. When you withdraw from a traditional 401(k) account, you get slapped with paying income tax, and typically a 10% penalty if you’re younger than 59 1⁄2. Read more: What is the retirement age for Social Security, 401(k), and IRA withdrawals? Here's an easy first step: Call your credit card issuer and ask for a lower interest rate, pointing out — if true — your history of on-time payments. If your provider won't budge, shop for a 0% balance transfer card. You can shift your current high-cost credit card debt over to a new card with a 0% promotional rate lasting as long as 21 months. There is, however, a 3%-5% transfer fee of the total amount you transfer, but that long interest-free period will give you some space to begin to pay the balance down. Automating your monthly payments and paying more than the minimum is the ticket to whittling away at your debts. There are a few strategies to consider for reducing your overall debt. The avalanche method involves paying off debt with the highest interest rate first. Other people opt for the snowball method, which focuses on smaller debts first. I’m in the avalanche school, but whatever works best for you matters. Alternatives also include consolidating all of your credit card debt with a personal loan. It’s possible to land an interest rate as low as about 7% over seven years if you have strong credit, which regrettably is not often the case if you’ve accumulated too much debt. Have a question about retirement? Personal finances? Anything career-related? Click here to drop Kerry Hannon a note. If you have multiple balances across several cards and a balance transfer card or personal loan won’t cover the total debt, I recommend tackling the highest annual interest rate first, while still making payments on the rest to steadily lower the interest charges. A nonprofit credit counselor may also be able to negotiate with your credit card issuers to give you a break on rates, but you will pay a fee for the service. The Justice Department website provides a list of approved credit counseling agencies.

Wall Street’s wiew on S&P 500 profits is souring as tariffs loom,"(Bloomberg) — Wall Street’s confidence in Corporate America’s profit engine is fraying, threatening more turbulence ahead for a badly bruised US stock market. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump DEI Purge Hits Affordable Housing Groups Electric Construction Equipment Promises a Quiet Revolution How Britain’s Most Bike-Friendly New Town Got Built Open Philanthropy Launches $120 Million Fund To Support YIMBY Reforms The Dark Prophet of Car-Clogged Cities Though the broad outlook for corporate earnings remains strong, analysts have been steadily trimming their expectations for company results in the next 12 months. Profit forecasts for S&P 500 Index companies have seen more downgrades than upgrades for 22 of the past 23 weeks, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, the longest stretch since early 2023. A darkening earnings picture would be an unwelcome development for stock investors, after worries over the economic impact of President Donald Trump’s tariff policies spurred a selloff that has dragged the S&P 500 around 8% from last month’s record. With robust earnings expansion needed to justify the market’s still-elevated valuations, signs that companies may struggle to meet profit expectations in the months ahead could further sour sentiment. “The earnings outlook is starting to crack,” said Eric Beiley, executive managing director of wealth management at Steward Partners. “This drawdown in stocks is signaling to sell-side analysts that they need to bring down their annual profit outlooks even further from here.” While first quarter earnings season kicks off on April 11 with a report from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other banks, some US companies are already sending worrying signals. American Airlines Group Inc. on Tuesday predicted its first-quarter loss would be roughly twice as big as expected, a day after bellwether Delta Air Lines Inc. cut its profit outlook in half, with both carriers citing weakening demand for air travel. Retailers including Kohl’s Corp., Abercrombie & Fitch Co. and Walmart Inc. have also sounded a cautious note. Analysts still see a 10% advance in S&P 500 earnings in 2025, down from a 13% forecast in early January, BI data show. But there may be ample room on the downside: Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management, said analysts will likely need to trim their annual S&P 500 profit estimates for 2025 to the high single-digits to account for the restraint tariffs would put on corporate profit margins. “There’s still the risk of estimates falling as more companies guide around Trump’s tariff policies,” said Scott Chronert, head of US equity strategy at Citigroup Inc. Others have already reeled in their earnings estimates. David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., on Tuesday reduced his full-year earnings growth estimate to 9% from 11%. He now sees the index ending the year at 6,200, down from a previous forecast of 6,500. That would still be a nearly 10% gain from Friday’s close. An earnings picture that grows too bleak could weigh on stocks. Evidence that investors are already bracing for more downside ahead can be seen in the record highs in gold, a popular safe haven. Prices for US government bonds, another popular destination for nervous investors, have risen since mid-February. Keith Buchanan, partner and senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments, has been selling some large-cap growth shares and raising his cash allocation. “It only makes sense to err on the side of caution,” he said. Of course, corporate results in recent years have shown resilience in the face of everything from soaring inflation to the highest interest rates in decades. Investors hope Trump will either soften or remove tariffs before they pinch profits. It could also take months before more sell-side analysts and companies guide forecasts lower, according to Michael Casper, equity strategist at BI. Such a scenario played out during Trump’s first term: though the US trade war with China heated up in the early months of 2018, the hit to corporate profits only showed up about a year later, according to BI data. Still, Casper noted that the economy had the tailwind of big corporate tax cuts during that period. Pressure has grown on Trump to push through a sweeping tax bill in his second term, as economic worries mount. For Michael Shaoul, chief executive officer and founding partner at Ion Macro Management, earnings have not figured into the recent selloff, which he said has been driven by investors unwinding overstretched positions in US megacaps and reallocating funds to Europe and Asia. He remains optimistic on corporate profits and the longer term performance of stocks. However, “if any negative earnings surprises are injected into the market, things will get more turbulent from here,” he said.

Ross Gerber sees no upside to Tesla stock. Here are the trades he's making instead.,"Ross Gerber is shifting his focus from Tesla to Nvidia, JPMorgan, and Meta Platforms amid the market dip. Nvidia's valuation and growth potential attract Gerber despite recent stock sell-off concerns. Gerber sold bitcoin for gold, citing volatility and uncertainty as key factors in his decision. Ross Gerber, known as a longtime backer of Tesla, sees no upside in the stock after its latest wipeout. So, where is he seeing opportunity instead? In a recent interview with BI, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management broke down some of his recent market moves amid the ongoing stock correction. Gerber, who is a long-term investor, was hunting for value on Monday when the Nasdaq Composite plunged 4% in its worst day since the 2022 bear market. ""I actually bought a little Nvidia yesterday,"" Gerber said, referencing the Monday sell-off. He also purchased shares of JPMorgan and Meta Platforms during the decline. For Nvidia, it's all about valuation. The AI stock sold off as much as 30% from its January peak amid tariff headwinds and fears of lower-than-expected profit margins. But Gerber highlighted that the stock is trading way too cheap given its elevated growth rate. ""You could actually buy Nvidia at 20x earnings and their expected earnings are expected to go up 75% this year and they're buying back stock,"" Gerber remarked. Bank stocks are also cheap, Gerber said, specifically highlighting JPMorgan as a name he's buying ""Banks will have a pretty good year with less regulation, and banks are cheap,"" Gerber said. JPMorgan is the largest bank in America and currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 11.2x, a 45% discount to the S&P 500's valuation multiple. Other stocks Gerber had a positive view on included GE Vernova, a renewable energy spin-off from General Electric, TKO Group, which owns UFC and WWE, and Disney. But perhaps the most surprising trade made by Gerber recently was selling the bulk of his bitcoin and using some of the proceeds to buy gold. Gerber said that after years of trading bitcoin, he's learned his lesson about its high volatility and was eager to take profits after the postelection surge. ""For my fund, we raised our allocation to 4% and then we made good money on it, so we were up big. But I've learned my lesson over the years trading bitcoin, it's just like I gotta take my money,"" Gerber said. Regarding gold, Gerber said the uncertainty around the Trump administration should be a tailwind for the risk-off metal. ""People buy gold, other countries will buy gold, Europe will buy gold, and just the idea that when you have volatility, there's really only one asset that is meant to really offset that,"" Gerber said. ""It used to be Treasurys and gold, but Treasurys don't actually perform that way as much anymore. I would argue there are substantial risks in Treasurys with this government, so the truth is gold is a really good place if things go crazy,"" he added. Gold hit a record high of $3,000 an ounce on Friday. The precious metal is up 13% year-to-date.

Why is the global rubber market likely to see shortages in 2025?,"Natural rubber production is expected to be below demand for the fifth year in a row in 2025. According to the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries (ANRPC), global natural rubber production is likely to rise 0.3% in 2025. However, worldwide demand is expected to far outstrip this number, at an estimated 1.8%. Rubber is used widely in a number of products such as automotive parts, industrial goods, footwear, conveyor belts, medical equipment and flooring, among several others. The material is prized primarily for its durability, elasticity, water resistance and low maintenance. The global rubber market is expected to hit around $65.7 billion (€60.3bn) by 2030, according to a Grand View Research report. Two kinds of rubber are mainly traded in global markets. These are synthetic rubber, which is made from natural gas and petrochemical sources, and natural rubber, which is derived from tropical trees. Some of the top natural rubber producing countries include Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia. Other countries such as China, India, the Ivory Coast, Sri Lanka, Cameroon and the Philippines are also major producers. Rubber futures dropped around 4% this week, trading at 195 US cents per kilogram on Friday morning, having also fallen 4.8% on a monthly basis. This was the lowest since mid-February, as traders balanced supply concerns with the effects of continuing trade tariffs. Related European stocks, euro rally as Germany strikes historic debt deal  One of the major reasons for the expected gap between natural rubber production supply and demand in 2025 is because of lagging output in several key countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia for several years now. This has mainly been caused by consistent adverse and extreme weather in recent years. That was the case in Thailand, which was hit by a heatwave at the beginning of last year, meaning that the low production season that rubber crops usually see between February and May was extended. Very hot weather also causes stunted growth in rubber trees. In Thailand, significant flooding and very heavy rainfall followed the heatwave in early 2024, which then also curbed peak season rubber output. These frequent extreme weather events can significantly decrease overall latex production. China, which is the fifth-largest rubber producer worldwide, has faced the same issue with adverse weather. Typhoons and heavy rains have significantly damaged vital rubber producing areas such as Cheng Mai and Lin Gao, on Hainan Island. Related Has your morning coffee got more expensive? Climate change could be to blame According to the European Forest Institute, Thailand’s overall rubber cultivation area fell by 4.5% between 2017 and 2022. This was mainly because of hotter weather, limited land availability, natural disasters, rising labour costs and the widespread impact of leaf flow disease, which can reduce tree productivity. A shift towards more profitable crops like palm trees, which can then be used for palm oil, has also impacted rubber production in several Southeast Asian countries. In several cases, low rubber production, mainly caused by the death of several rubber trees, may push farmers towards other crops. Other challenges such as deforestation and labour exploitation, as well as price volatility and competition from synthetic rubber, continue to plague the global natural rubber industry. Agroforestry, which is the process of planting trees and crops on the same land, can substantially boost rubber production. This is mainly by enhancing soil health, which in turn, leads to healthier and more productive rubber trees. Plants like bamboo, coffee or tea can be planted alongside rubber trees, along with fruit or timber trees. This practice can also help crops to be more resilient to extreme weather and climate change. In turn, this helps to protect farmers’ revenues, diversifying income streams by reducing dependence on a single crop. If farmers feel more financially secure, they are then more likely to continue producing some rubber, instead of switching to more profitable crops. Agroforestry also helps to increase land productivity and reduce dependence on chemical pesticides and fertilisers, as it enhances nutrient cycling and natural pest control. On top of this, the practice boosts the lifespan of rubber trees. The Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber (GPSNR), an industry body aiming to help develop a more sustainable rubber supply chain, recently revealed that it would provide funding to train 1,000 Thai farmers in agroforestry by 2025.

A government shutdown now seems unlikely. That's giving the stock market a much-needed boost.,"The US stock market rallied on Friday after days of pain brought on by Trump's trade war. Markets cheered after Sen. Chuck Schumer said he'd support a GOP spending bill. It means a government shutdown will likely be averted, delivering investors much-needed good news. After days of pain brought on by President Donald Trump's trade war, markets got some relief in Friday's session as developments in Washington, DC, indicated the government will avoid a shutdown. Major stock averages rose sharply on the unexpected news that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer would support the six-month stopgap bill from Republicans. The benchmark S&P 500 increased as much as 2% on Friday, with the biggest gains coming in the afternoon. It helped claw back some of the week's losses, although the benchmark is still down 2.5% over the past five days. The Nasdaq jumped as much as 2.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average peaked with a nearly-700-point gain. Here's where the market stood around 1:30 a.m. ET Friday: S&P 500: 5,620.97, up 1.8% Dow Jones Industrial Average: 41,416.27, up 1.5% (603 points) Nasdaq Composite: 17,684.32, up 2.2% Though Schumer pledged to oppose the bill earlier in the week, signaling the Democrats would opt for a shutdown, he ultimately conceded that his party would wield no control in such a scenario. ""The total off-ramp of a shutdown, how you stop a shutdown, is totally determined by the Republican House and Senate, and that is totally determined because they've shown complete, blind obeisance [to] Trump, DOGE, etc. They could keep us in a shutdown for months and months and months,"" he told reporters. While the move has angered some fellow Democrats who were ready to oppose the spending bill, investors cheered Schumer's about-face as it removed a layer of uncertainty in what's been a trying week for markets. The exuberance was enough for markets to sidestep fresh signs of consumer weakness. Friday's consumer sentiment report was the lowest reading since 2022, with US consumers facing tariff uncertainty and inflation fears. A barrage of tariff news this week crushed investor confidence and sent volatility soaring. The S&P 500 ended Thursday's session in a correction, down 10% from its February 19 high. At the same time, gold reached a record high of $3,000 an ounce on Friday, while Treasury yields have dropped in an investor flight to safety. Even with markets in retreat, the Trump White House has remained unfazed. On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the administration isn't worried about a ""little bit of volatility,"" and the focus is on the broader economy.

Here's what could go right for stocks after a brutal tariff-fueled wipeout,"The stock market has been hammered by tariff worries but a handful of catalysts could spark a turnaround. The stock market has been badly hurt by President Donald Trump's trade war so far, but one Wall Street research firm says there are potential catalysts on the horizon that could help turn the situation around for investors. Strategists at BCA Research said they see a handful of ""upside scenarios"" that could restart the rally. Though the scenarios may all be longshots, they're all plausible — and could lead to the major indexes climbing back to all-time-highs, Peter Berezin, the chief global strategist at the firm, said. The call is notable coming from BCA, which has called for a recession in 2025 and has one the lowest price targets for the S&P 500 on Wall Street this year. ""We continue to maintain a bearish view on equities on the grounds that the US will likely enter a recession this year,"" Berezin said. ""All that said, despite our bearish predisposition towards stocks, we are open-minded to anything that could challenge our thesis."" Here are five things the firm thinks could spark a turnaround for the market. Trump used the stock market to gauge the success of his presidency during his first term, though he's less focused on the market now. However, the president could be disciplined by markets and soften his trade policy as the decline in stocks becomes too steep to ignore. That dynamic hasn't played out so far. Berezin pointed to instances where Trump's team has communicated that the president is no longer using the stock market as a barometer for his success. Last weekend, Trump also acknowledged that the economy was going through a ""period of transition"" after his latest round of tariffs, which suggested to markets that the president is okay with some volatility for now. On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reiterated the administration's view that it will tolerate market volatility as it pursues its policy goals. ""Our strong suspicion is that the tolerance among Americans for economic pain is very low, especially in the case where the pain seems self-inflicted. This suggests that Trump will back down,"" Berezin said. Markets have been concerned that bond investors could stage a big sell-off in a revolt against Trump's plan to extend his 2017 tax cuts. That would send yields spiking toward a level that could hurt stocks. There's a chance that doesn't happen though, which would be positive for equities, BCA Research said. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond, an indicator of long-term interest rate expectations in the economy, spiked as high as 4.8% in early January — one sign that investors anticipated less demand for the US debt, which could be due to concerns about an unsustainable fiscal situation. Yields have since declined, a sign that those worries have abated for now. The 10-year yield traded around 4.3% on Friday. ""Investors should monitor Treasury term premia to gauge whether risk premia on bonds are rising to dangerous levels. So far, that has not happened,"" Berezin said. Fiscal stimulus and structural reforms in Europe could end up boosting growth abroad — something that could be a positive for US markets as well. ""There is significant scope for gains from knocking down internal barriers to trade. This is true in the European Union. It is also true in countries such as Canada,"" Berezin said, pointing to estimates that removing trade barriers impacting Canada could raise GDP by as much as 8% in the nation. European stocks have already done well so far this year. The EURO STOXX 50 Index is up 9% since the start of January, outperforming the S&P 500, which is down 5% year-to-date. Oil prices are already depressed but they could fall further as a result of Trump's plan to boost US energy production. When prices slump as the result of increased supply, that has traditionally been a positive signal for stocks, Berezin said. Things already look positive on the production side. OPEC+ has said it would wind back some of its production curbs starting in April of this year, and Trump, who declared a national energy emergency on his first day in office, has said he would pour more resources into US energy infrastructure. Oil prices have declined since the start of the year. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded around $70 a barrel on Friday, down from a peak of $82 a barrel earlier in the year. AI could end up boosting productivity way more than expected, which would be be a boon for the US economy and markets, the firm said. BCA Research estimated that growth could scale anywhere from 30 to 100 times as a result of AI. That's similar to what the US economy saw during the agricultural and industrial revolutions, it noted. Still, the firm noted that productivity gains could take a while to show up in the economy. And while the US is in the midst of an AI investment boom, there are depreciating returns on those investments, which could pose a risk to investors.

How Intel Became the S&P 500’s Top Performer This Week,"picture alliance / Getty Images  Intel's stock was the S&P 500's top performer this week after the chipmaker named a new CEO. The company announced Wednesday that veteran semiconductor executive Lip-Bu Tan will be its new CEO, effective March 18. The appointment also follows speculation about deal talks, with Reuters reporting TSMC approached other chip firms about forming a joint venture to run Intel's foundry.  Intel's (INTC) stock was the S&P 500's top performer this week after the chipmaker named a new CEO amid speculation about the future of its foundry business. The company announced Wednesday that Lip-Bu Tan, the former CEO of semiconductor software firm Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), will become its new CEO as of next Tuesday, sending shares soaring. They've added close to 17% this week, at $24.05 as of Friday's close. Deutsche Bank analysts called the move a ""desirable outcome"" for Intel, highlighting Tan's ""extensive expertise in the semiconductor ecosystem."" Bank of America analysts suggested Tan could usher in a strategic shift for the company’s foundry business, which has been the subject of acquisition rumors for months. Earlier in the week, Reuters reported Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) approached other chip firms Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO) about forming a joint venture to own and run the U.S. chipmaker's foundry division. The foundry has also been viewed as a potential beneficiary of the Trump administration's stated goal of ensuring artificial intelligence chips are designed and manufactured in the U.S. The Reuters report said Trump asked TSMC for help in turning around Intel. With this week's gains, Intel's stock is up 20% in 2025, making it the best-performing chip stock on the S&P 500 for the year so far. That’s a stark change from 2024, which saw the chipmaker's stock lose more than half of its value.

Meta Is The Only Magnificent 7 Stock In The Green In 2025—Watch These Key Levels,"Meta Platforms shares jumped on Friday amid a broader market rally, after logging their biggest one-day drop since July the previous session. Meta is the only member of the Magnificent Seven group of mega-cap technology stocks to be in positive territory so far this year. Investors should watch major support levels on Meta's chart around $535 and $460, while also monitoring crucial resistance levels near $635 and $740.  Meta Platforms (META) shares jumped on Friday amid a broader market rally, after logging their biggest one-day drop since July the previous session. The social media giant's stock has come under pressure over the past month as the broader market has tumbled, with Big Tech stocks suffering outsize losses amid concerns about lofty valuations and slowing growth. Meta shares are down 18% from their record high set in mid-February. However, Meta is the only member of the Magnificent Seven group of mega-cap technology stocks that remains in positive territory for 2025. The stock is up nearly 4% since the start of the year, while each of the other Mag 7 stocks is down at least 8%. Below, we break down the technicals on Meta’s chart and identify major price levels worth watching out for amid the possibility for further price swings. Meta shares staged a decisive breakdown below an ascending channel on Monday before the price retested the pattern’s lower trendline in Wednesday’s trading session. Bears used the bounce as an opportunity to accelerate selling yesterday, before today's recovery. Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) confirms weak price momentum with a reading near its August lows, though looming oversold conditions may trigger short-term recovery rallies in the stock. Let’s use technical analysis to locate major support and resistance levels that investors may be monitoring. Meta shares rose 3% on Friday to close at $607.60, after falling nearly 5% yesterday. The first overhead level to monitor is $635, an area that provides a confluence of resistance from the ascending channel’s lower trendline that sits alongside peaks which formed on the chart in December and January. A convincing close above this level may see bulls make another run at the $740 level, a location on the chart where Meta shares would likely attract significant attention near their all-time high (ATH). The first support level to watch sits around $535. The shares could find buying interest in this area near a multi-month trendline that connects three prominent peaks on the chart between April and August last year. Selling below this important technical level could see the stock revisit lower support at the $460 level. Investors who favor buy-and-hold strategies may look for entry points in this region near the low of a consolidation period that followed last year’s February breakaway gap, a location that also roughly aligns with the July and August troughs.

Property developer Country Garden's unit forecasts higher annual earnings,"(Reuters) - Country Garden Services, the property services arm of China's Country Garden, on Friday forecast a higher full-year profit on the back of lower impairment charges. The property services arm expects a net profit attributable between 1.60 billion yuan ($221.03 million) and 2 billion yuan for fiscal 2024 ended December, compared with 292.3 million yuan a year earlier. Country Garden Services said it benefited from optimising some businesses it had acquired previously that led to lower impairment charges for the year ended 2024. The company is scheduled to publish its fiscal 2024 results on March 27. Its parent company Country Garden and a string of other real estate developers defaulted on debt repayment obligations over the past three years that affected China's economically crucial property sector and forced Beijing to announce support measures. Once a top developer by sales, Country Garden said earlier this year it proposed a deal to its offshore creditors to cut its debt by $11.6 billion. In January this year, the debt-laden property builder said it expected to post a smaller annual loss in 2024 after reporting a record 178.4 billion yuan loss in 2023.

BMW sees earnings hit from US tariffs as EU warns against escalation,"By Christoph Steitz, Balazs Koranyi and David Lawder FRANKFURT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -German carmaker BMW said on Friday it expected tariffs to cost it 1 billion euros ($1.09 billion) this year, while European officials warned the U.S. economy would be the biggest loser if President Donald Trump pursues an ""idiotic"" trade war. BMW is directly in the firing line of the trade spat between Washington and the European Union, set to escalate in early April as Trump imposes ""reciprocal"" tariffs to match higher duty rates of EU and other countries and counteract their non-tariff trade barriers. Trump has increased tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminium imports and imposed a 25% duty on vehicles from Mexico that do not comply with North American trade deal's rules of origin, including BMWs. The EU, which Trump has labeled ""hostile and abusive,"" on trade, is in line for more U.S. tariffs on April 2. The bloc has set plans to retaliate while calling for dialogue. EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic spoke with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Friday about the spiralling tariff conflict, calling it an important exchange and ""a key part of better understanding each other."" ""There's a lot of work ahead but let's stay focused and explore the best ways to move forward in the right direction,"" Sefocovic said in a post on X. Sefcovic has previously said that the EU is ready to discuss lowering tariffs on both sides of the Atlantic. The conversation comes a day after Trump responded to the EU retaliation plan by threatening to slap a 200% tariff on wine cognac and other alcohol imports from Europe. Diageo, the world's largest spirits maker, argued in a public comment letter to the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) that the U.S. should consider tougher rules of origin in trade agreements as an alternative to tariffs. French Finance Minister Eric Lombard said on Friday a trade war between the EU and its U.S. ally would be ""idiotic"" but that the 27-country bloc would respond in kind to further tariffs. BMW Chief Executive Oliver Zipse meanwhile said the company expected a 1 billion euro ($1.09 billion) hit to its 2025 earnings from the newly imposed U.S. tariffs and EU duties on its China-made electric vehicles. He described the firm's estimate of the impact as ""conservative"" but said executives did not expect all the tariffs imposed so far to remain in place for the whole year. BMW, one of Europe's biggest carmakers, reported a 37% drop in profits for last year. The effects of a prolonged trade war could hurt U.S. companies as well. EV maker Tesla - whose CEO Elon Musk has become a key adviser to Trump, in charge of slashing federal spending - is exposed to reciprocal actions from other countries, the company told U.S. trade representatives in a letter on Thursday. Tesla's sales have suffered across Europe since Musk has stepped up his support of far-right politicians in several countries; its shares are down roughly 50% since mid-December. The company sent the letter as a response to a request for comment from the USTR's office on foreign trade practices. All told, nearly 750 comments were received by the Tuesday deadline, according to the USTR Web site. UNCERTAINTY Though still not yet in full swing, the trade measures and countermeasures are already affecting economic growth because nervous firms and consumers are holding back spending or delaying investment. ""Uncertainty has gone way up,"" said Bill Campbell, portfolio manager at investment management firm DoubleLine Capital. ""People are going to hold back on hiring, on investing until you can get some more clarity on ... how many tariffs are going to be implemented."" U.S. consumer sentiment on Friday plunged to a nearly 2-1/2-year low in March amid worries that tariffs would boost prices and undercut the economy, according to the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, erasing all gains in the index since Trump's election victory in November. Stocks rebounded in both the U.S. and Europe on Friday after a rough week driven by tariff worries that pushed the S&P 500 into correction territory and safe haven gold to a record above $3,000 an ounce. [GLOB/MKTS] In a possible sign the uncertainty is already taking a toll, Britain's economy contracted unexpectedly in January, extending a run of stop-start data that has beset the Labour government's attempts to spark growth. Late on Thursday, German central bank chief Joachim Nagel described Trump's policies as ""a horror show"" that could tip Germany into recession, while he and his French counterpart warned the trade war would rebound on the U.S. economy. ""It's a shock for the world economy, but even more so for the American economy. It's firstly a tragedy for the American economy,"" French central bank governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said.

"A Look Back at Beverages, Alcohol, and Tobacco Stocks’ Q4 Earnings: Brown-Forman (NYSE:BF.B) Vs The Rest Of The Pack","Let’s dig into the relative performance of Brown-Forman (NYSE:BF.B) and its peers as we unravel the now-completed Q4 beverages, alcohol, and tobacco earnings season. These companies' performance is influenced by brand strength, marketing strategies, and shifts in consumer preferences. Changing consumption patterns are particularly relevant and can be seen in the rise of cannabis, craft beer, and vaping or the steady decline of soda and cigarettes. Companies that spend on innovation to meet consumers where they are with regards to trends can reap huge demand benefits while those who ignore trends can see stagnant volumes. Finally, with the advent of the social media, the cost of starting a brand from scratch is much lower, meaning that new entrants can chip away at the market shares of established players. The 15 beverages, alcohol, and tobacco stocks we track reported a mixed Q4. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 1.5% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 0.6% below. While some beverages, alcohol, and tobacco stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 3.3% since the latest earnings results.

Q4 Earnings Highs And Lows: Powell (NASDAQ:POWL) Vs The Rest Of The Electrical Systems Stocks,"Quarterly earnings results are a good time to check in on a company’s progress, especially compared to its peers in the same sector. Today we are looking at Powell (NASDAQ:POWL) and the best and worst performers in the electrical systems industry. Like many equipment and component manufacturers, electrical systems companies are buoyed by secular trends such as connectivity and industrial automation. More specific pockets of strong demand include Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity and the 5G telecom upgrade cycle, which can benefit companies whose cables and conduits fit those needs.

Cope, Powell’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Powell recorded a strong start to Fiscal 2025 highlighted by new order growth of 36%. We saw strong order activity across each of our market sectors, as our Electric Utility and Oil & Gas markets continue to benefit from robust tailwinds that support our expectation for volume growth in 2025. We were awarded a large LNG project situated along the U.S. Gulf Coast during the quarter as we expect this market sector to see improved activity levels relative to Fiscal 2024. Revenue also grew 24% and we delivered earnings per diluted share of $2.86 despite what is typically a seasonally softer first quarter. Overall, we remain very encouraged by both our backlog as well as the volume and composition of projects in our pipeline.” The stock is down 31.3% since reporting and currently trades at $168.06.

"Recession risks have risen, but it's not a baseline: El-Erian","US stocks slumped on Monday on growing concerns about the economy. It comes after President Trump, in interviews over the weekend, declined to rule out a recession. On Morning Brief, Queens' College, Cambridge president Mohamed El-Erian weighs in, saying though recession risks have risen, it is not his base case. ""My probability of US recession has gone up from 10% to 25 to 30%. So it's not the baseline... The reason why it's not the baseline has to do with the structural strengths of the US economy. It also has to do with what we've been promised down the road in terms of deregulation, tax cuts, and the reality of low energy prices,"" he says.

Tariff uncertainty puts market in price discovery mode,"The current economic landscape remains uncertain as the market (^GSPC, ^IXIC, ^DJI) faces mixed signals from inflation data and ongoing tariff issues. Yahoo Finance Senior Markets Reporter Josh Schafer joins Catalysts host Madison Mills to discuss how tariff uncertainty, rather than economic data, may be the dominant factor driving market volatility.

Corrections usually don't amount to much: Chart of the Week,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings The S&P 500 (^GSPC) narrowly entered correction on Thursday, meaning the benchmark index has retreated 10% from its last all-time high on Feb. 19. But whether the S&P 500 has officially reached a technical term used to describe a drawdown is perhaps really neither here nor there. The key question of course is how often sell-offs like this keep getting worse. Friday offered at least a very temporary answer to that with the S&P 500 rising more than 2.1%%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gaining 1.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) 2.6%. Interestingly enough, research from Carson Group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick shows that 10% corrections not only happen quite frequently but often end up being the main event instead of extending to a bear market, defined by a 20% drop from an all-time high. Detrick's work shows that since World War II, the S&P 500 has experienced 48 corrections. However, only 12 of those corrections have turned into bear markets, meaning 75% of the time, a correction doesn't spiral all the way down to a bear market. ""Maybe we go into a correction, but we do not see a bear market coming,"" Detrick told Yahoo Finance. ""Early in the post-election year, choppiness is normal and that's kind of what's happening."" The swift nature of the recent pullback is also typically a good barometer for how the index bounces out of correction, according to BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski. In a research note on Friday, Belski highlighted that outside of the pandemic, no correction since World War II that happened as quickly as the current one has led to a bear market. ""These types of corrections that happen this fast go right back up and recover just as fast, if not more,"" Belski told Yahoo Finance. He added this makes him ""very comfortable"" with his 6,700 year-end target for the S&P 500. ""In terms of fundamentals, they're still flashing green, not yellow, not red,"" Belski said.

Washington has averted a government shutdown,"Washington averted a government shutdown after an up-and-down week saw House Republicans offering a united front and resistant Democrats cornered. The key moment on Friday was an early evening procedural vote in the US Senate that ended debate on a continuing resolution (CR). The final 62-38 vote included 10 Senate Democratic votes in the affirmative. Their support pushed the count above the required 60-vote threshold. Democratic-caucusing Sens. Chuck Schumer, Catherine Cortez Masto, Dick Durbin, John Fetterman, Kirsten Gillibrand, Maggie Hassan, Angus King, Gary Peters, Brian Schatz, and Jeanne Shaheen all voted yes. Republican Sen. Rand Paul voted no in what was otherwise a party-line vote. A final vote then followed later, shortly after 6 p.m., and passed comfortably. ""The CR is a bad bill, but as bad as the CR is, I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option,"" said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer hours before the vote as he announced he would be voting yes. The spending plan's passage set off another round of Democratic Party agita and soul-searching, with Schumer and other Senate Democrats saying they had no choice but to help push through the 99-page bill written by Republicans. It will keep the government open until Sept. 30 with GOP priorities attached and little in the way of concessions to Democrats. The bill is set to offer increased spending on issues like defense and immigration and cuts elsewhere to other programs. The changes overall are a proverbial drop in the bucket of America's fiscal situation given the country has carried multitrillion-dollar budget deficits in recent years. ""What we're leaving in terms of debt, what the next generation will be inheriting, and at this point it's not just an economic risk, I think it's a huge national security risk,"" Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Friday in a new episode of Yahoo Finance’s Capitol Gains podcast. Her group recently pointed out that the US government has already run up $1.1 trillion in new deficit spending in just the first five months of the current fiscal year. The group also found that this week’s bill will likely have the net fiscal impact of adding $7 billion to the debt in the years ahead, largely because cuts to the IRS will allow more people to avoid paying taxes and drive down collections. It also doesn’t help that this week’s fight came during a climate of deep economic unease. Stock sell-offs have put markets into a correction at the same time as firms slash S&P 500 year-end targets. Trump's trade war also continues unabated and, so far, the president appears unconcerned about its impact on the economy. Friday’s votes capped a week of standoffs on Capitol Hill that began with observers estimating a one-in-three chance of a shutdown as House Republicans planned to muscle through their bill with slim margins and plenty of initial skepticism that they could succeed. Even Trump at the time tossed up his hands and told reporters Sunday about a shutdown: ""It could happen ... you never know."" But House Speaker Mike Johnson’s gambit worked, with a 217 to 213 vote that advanced the stopgap measure and forced Democrats' hand. Speaker Johnson saw only one member of his own party, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, oppose the bill and one Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, move to support the GOP plan. The path to passage in the Senate was always more complicated, and Democratic Leader Schumer briefly spiked shutdown odds midweek when he signaled that Democrats would be opposed. ""Our caucus is unified,"" Schumer said at the time, promising to block the plan and pushing a one-month bill instead. But then the Democratic leader quickly saw his Senate caucus split as many voted no, with others, including Schumer, voting yes in an acknowledgment of the political reality. For his part, on Friday, Trump offered a perhaps facetious, ""Congratulations to Chuck Schumer for doing the right thing."" He then inadvertently reminded wary markets that plenty of opportunities for government dysfunction lie ahead. ""The big Tax Cuts, L.A. fire fix, Debt Ceiling Bill, and so much more, is coming,"" the president wrote. This post has been updated with additional developments.

"Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500 soar, Nasdaq rebounds in best day since November to cap volatile week","US stocks bounced back sharply on Friday to cap a volatile week on Wall Street as the risk of a government shutdown eased while investors stayed on watch for the next move in an escalating trade war. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) climbed more than 2.1% after the benchmark index sank on Thursday to close in correction territory. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped over 2.6% as tech stocks soared. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved up more than 600 points, or 1.6%. Stocks have had a rough week as uncertainty over President Donald Trump's tariff shifts whipsawed markets and overshadowed otherwise encouraging signals about the economy. All three major gauges registered weekly losses of more than 2% after the S&P 500 (^GSPC) joined the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) in correction. It took less than a month for the benchmark index to fall into correction, the fifth-fastest such move in the past 75 years, according to Ritholtz Wealth Management. But Wall Street spirits brightened as Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer backed off a threat to block a funding bill aimed at averting a government shutdown at the weekend. At the same time, gold (GC=F) broke above $3,000 an ounce for the first time amid warnings about the economic damage from Trump's tariffs. On Thursday, Trump said he didn't plan to ""bend at all"" in the escalating round of tit-for-tat tariffs with America's biggest trading partners. Read more: The latest on Trump's tariff plans Concerns that the US economy is showing signs of strain have receded after data this week showed inflation heading in the direction desired by the Federal Reserve, which holds its policy meeting next week. But the details of that data could give policymakers pause for thought. It's clear, however, that consumers are feeling less and less enthused about the state of their pocketbooks. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey came in at 57.9 on Friday, well below expectations of 63. US stocks rebounded sharply to close near the highs of the session on Friday, though all three major averages still finished the week with losses. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) climbed more than 2% after the broad-based index sank on Thursday to close in correction territory. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) had its best day since the day after the election, up 2.6% as tech stocks soared. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) climbed more than 600 points, or 1.6%. The risk of a government shutdown faded while investors were on alert regarding any further tariff developments from the Trump administration after this week's market action. Despite Friday's rally, all three major gauges registered weekly losses of more than 2%, with the Dow suffering its worst week since 2023. With just 20 minutes left of trading on Friday, Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was trading near session highs, on pace to see its best day since January. Tech stocks led the gains as all three major averages rebounded to cap a volatile week on Wall Street. However, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq were on track to end the week lower. All eleven sectors of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) were in green territory during Friday's session with most assets posting gains. Oil jumped on Friday as prices held relatively steady for the week as traders assessed tariff uncertainty along with continuing efforts to end the Ukraine war. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures rose to settle above $67 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, rose above $70 per barrel. On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin indicated Moscow would support a US-led ceasefire in principle, but some issues would need to be discussed. ""Most traders still feel some kind of a peace deal is near which would likely add Russian barrels to the market,"" Dennis Kissler, senior vice president at BOK Financial, wrote said in a note on Friday. ""Technically WTI April crude remains in a choppy type of trade torn between tariffs weakening global demand and tighter US storage numbers with the beginning of driving season,"" he added. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi: Read more here. Tech led the rebound on Friday, but was still on track to end the week with losses. The S&P 500 Tech Sector (XLK) jumped nearly 3% during Friday's session, followed by Energy (XLE), Financials (XLF), and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) as the broader market gained. Despite Friday's sharp rally, Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Tech stocks were still on track to close out the week with losses as the 5-day chart below shows Tech stocks rebounded on Friday, leading the Nasdaq to gain more than 2.3% to cap a volatile week on Wall Street. Nvidia (NVDA) surged more than 5% as the AI chip heavyweight was on track to close out the week with 7% gains. Meanwhile, the rest of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks gained on Friday but were still headed toward weekly losses. EV giant Tesla (TSLA) gained more than 3% during the session. Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) also rose more than 2%. Shares of DocuSign (DOCU) soared over 18% as of midday trading on Friday after the electronic signature company beat earnings and revenue estimates and more customers adopted its artificial intelligence offerings. As Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi writes, DocuSign's business remained brisk despite rising concerns of an economic growth slowdown in the US. ""As I looked at our February numbers, for example, our transaction volumes were pretty much on target with what we had expected — not seeing any major impact there,"" Thygesen said on Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief on Friday. ""So at this point, we haven't seen any impact of the recent volatility."" Read the DocuSign earnings breakdown here. In a new note to clients published Friday, BMO chief investment strategist Brian Belski — one of the Street's staunchest bulls who was quick to call the market turnaround back in 2022 — argues that the uncertainty and fear of this market moment is no reason to rip up your view on markets and the economy. ""Given the increased negative banter and many macro forecasts being revised to the downside, we have been inundated by clients on not only our opinion, but more directly — why we are NOT changing our view,"" Belski wrote. In addition to not knowing the process of other firms and arguing that company-specific trends are being extrapolated to the broad market, Belski added: ""Unfortunately, uncertainty generates emotion, which comes from fear. ... To be blunt, we believe it is inappropriate to be changing forecasts for the sake of uncertainty and fear."" On Thursday, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) entered correction territory, defined as a 10% drop from recent highs. ""We know that corrections do not necessarily equate to bear markets,"" Belski added. More broadly, Belski sees the way the market has acted over the last two years — essentially going up unabated amid AI enthusiasm and riding the wave of a strong economy — as having set us up for the current moment of instability. Here's Belski, with the money quote on where things stand in his team's mind as we head toward the end of a rough week for markets: Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose above $83,000 per token on Friday amid an overall market rebound. The world's largest cryptocurrency has been range-bound over the past week fluctuating between $77,000 and $84,000 as investors reacted to the Trump administration's tariff policies and growing worries of an economic slowdown. ""As the market recovers from the turmoil caused by tariffs and becomes more certain about the direction of trade policy, cryptocurrencies may find themselves in a better place than they were previously,"" Samer Hasn, a senior market analyst at XS.com, said on Friday. Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferré reports: Read more here. Consumer sentiment tumbled in March, as the impacts of President Trump's tariff policies and elevated prices remain a top concern for Americans. The latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey released Friday showed sentiment hit its lowest level since November 2022. The index slid to a reading of 57.9, below the 64.7 seen last month and the 63 expected by economists. Pessimism over the inflation outlook soared again in March as one-year inflation expectations jumped to 4.9% from 4.3% the month prior. Just two months ago, consumers had only expected inflation of 3.3% over the next year. Long-run inflation expectations, which track expectations over the next five to 10 years, climbed too, hitting 3.9% in March, up from 3.4% in February. This marked the largest month-over-month increase in long-run inflation expectations since 1993. Tesla (TSLA) shares slumped recently, erasing post-Election Day gains, and closed down nearly 3% Thursday. Tesla warned that retaliatory tariffs could hurt its operations and urged the US to rethink trade policies. CNN Reports: Read more here Stocks rebounded on Friday following steep losses in the prior session as the risk of a US government shutdown waned and investors eyed the escalating trade war. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose about 0.9% after the index closed in correction territory on Thursday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained more than 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.6%. Investors are keeping a close eye on the trade war, which has set all three major averages on pace to end the week lower. Gold is set to be the big winner this week after crossing $3,000 an ounce for the first time. The precious metal is on track for a second week of gains as investors flock to the safe haven amid tariff uncertainties and expectations that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates again. Reuters reports: Read more here. China's stock benchmark closed at its highest since mid-December amid growing optimism for more Beijing policy support and a rising appetite for Chinese names from global investors. Shanghai's CSI 300 jumped 2.4% as investors dived into consumer stocks. Meanwhile, the Hang Seng China Enterprises index (^HSCE) in Hong Kong finished with a 2.7% gain. China's authorities are seen as poised to bring in policies to boost consumer spending and confidence, after the financial regulator laid out plans to encourage banks to offer loans. But Beijing appears to be struggling to find ways to meet its spending targets, even as Elon Musk-led DOGE in the US shoots for $1 trillion in spending cuts. The risk of economic damage from President Trump's tariff hikes also looms large. At the same time, recession worries sparked by that trade war are driving global investors to take cover in an unusual haven, Chinese stocks, analysts suggest. The stocks are trading 30% under their 2021 highs, while the 17% gain for Hong Kong's Hang Seng (^HSI) since Trump's election far outshines the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 9% drop Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer writes in today's Morning Brief: Tesla (TSLA) shares moved up 1.7% in premarket trading, clawing back a chunk of Thursday's 3% loss after a report that the EV maker is planning a lower-cost Model Y for China. The smaller version of Tesla's best-selling model will cost at least 20% less to manufacture, Reuters reported. The plan is a bid to regain market share in China, where Tesla has lost a lot of ground. Its shares have dropped over 30% in the past month as sales slid in Europe, too, and amid dismay at CEO Elon Musk's role on President Trump's team. The stock has erased all its post-election gains.

How comedian Mo Welch came back from financial rock bottom,"Listen and subscribe to Living Not So Fabulously on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. The gig economy has become the primary source of income for many workers in the United States — especially those in creative fields. But for the roughly 59 million US workers who classify as independent workers, gig work can lead to financial insecurity. That was the case for comedian and cartoonist Mo Welch, who admitted to being ""so bad at money managing"" early in her career. On a recent episode of Living Not So Fabulously, Welch shared how she frequently felt like she was ""masking"" her financial situation to appear more put together around her peers. ""A lot of it was just being extremely poor for a very long time — which did lead to a lot of great jokes,"" Welch said (see video above or listen below). ""But it's a lot of jokes that I'm happy to retire because they were also sad."" After moving to Los Angeles with a car full of wigs and other costume supplies, Welch admitted that even with the support of various odd jobs, paying for the classes and experiences she needed to further her career in comedy remained daunting. ""I actually had this girlfriend who was good at her finances and had a trust fund, and she was like, 'Well, basically, you're bad at finances and you're a comedian ... so you never know when your next check is coming,'"" Welch recounted. The girlfriend then suggested Welch attend a Debtors Anonymous meeting, where she could meet others who were also freelancers and struggling with their money. Read more: How to pay off credit card debt when your budget's tight Welch said it wasn't until she accepted that she needed help that she felt she could stop ""pretending"" to have her situation in order. ""I had to put like a lot of pride aside and put that shame away and be like, OK, I actually do need help with this because I was not taught how to manage a dollar,"" she said, noting that it made her repeatedly question her success in her career. ""The financial shame was always like rock bottom.""   As Welch built a community of freelancers, she eventually learned how much independent workers can write off on their taxes and how to find the right accountant to help her find those tax breaks. ""Unfortunately, with comedy, you're waiting for something to happen,"" Welch said. ""It's not necessarily that I got my shit together. For me, in comedy, it did take a decade to make any money."" Welch's big break didn't come until she drew the first iteration of ""Blair,"" the deadpan cartoon she started while visiting her mom during a particularly low point in her career. ""That is what led me to, like, my first big paycheck in Hollywood, which was getting a book deal and being able to sell that as a TV script and working with Chelsea Handler to produce ['Blair'],"" she shared. ""And that's when things really started rolling — once I really leaned into my rock bottom and was honest with myself and said, 'Hey, wake up. You need to make a change here.'""

""We see continued strong demand,"" Rubrik co-founder and CEO Bipul Sinha told me on Yahoo Finance on Friday. Sinha's comments echo those of Docusign CEO Allan Thygesen to Yahoo Finance earlier this morning. Sinha added, ""We are confident in delivering on our full-year goals."" Shares of the cybersecurity firm priced its April 2024 IPO at $32, above the high end of their expected range. The stock opened for trading at $38.60.

""As I looked at our February numbers, for example, our transaction volumes were pretty much on target with what we had expected — not seeing any major impact there,"" Thygesen said.

Americans sour on economy as inflation expectations hit highest level since 1991,"Consumer sentiment tumbled in March as the impacts of President Donald Trump's tariff policies and elevated price increases remain top concerns for Americans. The latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey released Friday showed sentiment hit its lowest level since November 2022. The index slid to a reading of 57.9, below the 64.7 seen last month and the 63 expected by economists. Pessimism over the inflation outlook soared again in March as one year-inflation expectations jumped to 4.9% from 4.3% the month prior. Just two months ago, consumers had only expected inflation of 3.3% over the next year. Long-run inflation expectations, which track expectations over the next five to 10 years, climbed, too, hitting 3.9% in March, up from 3.4% in February. This marks the highest level of long-term inflation expectations since 1991. Also in the release, the expected change in unemployment hit its lowest level since the Great Financial Crisis.  ""While current economic conditions were little changed, expectations for the future deteriorated across multiple facets of the economy, including personal finances, labor markets, inflation, business conditions, and stock markets,"" University of Michigan Survey of Consumers director Joanne Hsu said in the release. ""Many consumers cited the high level of uncertainty around policy and other economic factors."" Hsu added that frequent gyrations in economic policies make it ""very difficult"" for consumers to plan for the future and therefore weigh on sentiment. The recent tumble in consumer sentiment has come as the new Trump administration has slapped tariffs on imports from multiple countries but frequently flip-flopped on what the actual tariff rates will be and when they'll be implemented. The European Union and Canada have now also threatened retaliatory tariffs on the United States. The tariff back-and-forth largely hasn't hit incoming inflation data yet. Earlier this week, a report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that its ""core"" Producer Price Index (PPI) — which tracks the price changes companies see and excludes food and energy — rose 3.4% from the year prior, down from the 3.6% seen in January. The day before, the bureau's Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed core prices rose 3.1% in February, the lowest yearly increase in core CPI since April 2021. Capital Economics assistant economist Harry Chambers noted that given recent data, the increase in inflation expectations seen in Friday's survey was ""entirely consumers’ increasing concerns about the impact of tariffs."" ""The plunge in the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index in March, paired with the surge in inflation expectations, indicates that consumers’ concerns about the impact of the Trump administration’s policies are growing,"" Chambers wrote. The survey's release comes one day after the S&P 500 (^GSPC) officially entered correction, falling more than 10% from its Feb. 19 all-time high. Wall Street strategists have recently noted that the uncertainty around Trump's policies has been a key driver of the recent sell-off. Guggenheim Partners Investment Management CIO Anne Walsh told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday that the ""the on, then off, then on and then off again narrative"" surrounding tariffs is driving volatility in the market. And as long as that persists, there likely isn't a direct path higher for stocks. ""It doesn't feel like a smooth trajectory [for stocks] because of all of the noise,"" Walsh said.

"Gold reaches $3,000 as trade war escalates, economic uncertainty rises","Gold made the sprint to $3,000 on Friday as uncertainties about the economy and an escalating trade war drove up demand for the safe-haven asset. Gold (GC=F) futures rose to hover above $3,008 per ounce while spot gold reached above $3,001. The precious metal was on track for a second straight week of gains amid new data indicating moderating inflation and the announcement of retaliatory tariffs from the United States' trading partners. ""Though it feels like a psychological threshold, gold at $3,000 might just be a stepping stone if trade wars deepen,"" said Tony Redondo, founder of Cosmos Currency Exchange. ""That said, it’s not all about Trump. Central banks, interest rate bets, geopolitical tensions, and inflation concerns are all stoking the flames."" Read more: How to invest in gold in 4 steps Trade tensions grew this week after President Trump threatened 200% tariffs on wine and spirit imports from Europe on Thursday. The threat followed the EU's announcement of retaliatory tariffs after the US put a 25% duty on steel and aluminum. Gold is up more than 12% year to date after making multiple record highs in recent months. ""All eyes are on how gold continues to play a role as a safe haven asset,"" said Joe Cavatoni, market strategist at the World Gold Council. ""With rising inflation expectations, lower rates, and continued uncertainty, we continue to see support for gold looking ahead.” Wall Street has been playing catch-up by raising price targets to keep pace with gold's rise. In a note on Thursday, Macquarie Group predicted the precious metal will touch $3,500 in the third quarter. ""Year-to-date, gold has been running ahead of our expectations,"" wrote Marcus Garvey, head of commodities strategy at Macquarie. ""We are raising our gold price forecast to a 3Q25 quarter average peak of $3,150 per ounce and our single point price high to $3,500 per ounce,"" he added. Wall Street strategists have attributed much of these gains to continued central bank buying and tariff uncertainty, including the possibility that even imports of the precious metal into the US won't be spared. Institutional investors have shipped elevated amounts of physical gold bars to vaults in New York in a move to front-run tariffs and take advantage of a price disparity between London and New York.

"Mortgage and refinance rates today, March 15, 2025: Inflation data leads to rate increases","Some advertisements and offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure. Mortgage rates are up across the board today. According to Zillow, the 30-year fixed interest rate has increased by 10 basis points to 6.59%, and the 15-year fixed rate has risen by 15 basis points to 5.93%. Two inflation reports — the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the core Producer Price Index (PPI) — came out this week. Both reports showed that inflation slowed in February, but not enough that economists expect the Federal Reserve to cut the federal funds rate soon. There had been speculation that the Fed could lower its rate in the May meeting, but now June looks more likely. If you want to buy a house before summer, you may be better off starting now than holding out for mortgage rates to decrease. Have questions about buying, owning, or selling a house?

Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case. You can use Yahoo Finance's free Yahoo's free mortgage calculator to see how various interest rates and term lengths will impact your monthly mortgage payment. It also shows how the home price and down payment amount play into things. Our calculator includes homeowners insurance and property taxes in your monthly payment estimate. You even have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues if those apply to you. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest. There are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable. A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes. The main disadvantage to 30-year fixed mortgage rates is mortgage interest — both in the short and long term. A 30-year fixed term comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed term, and it’s higher than the intro rate to a 30-year ARM. The higher your rate, the higher your monthly payment. You’ll also pay much more in interest over the life of your loan due to both the higher rate and the longer term. The pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are basically swapped from the 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan. However, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term. Dig deeper: 15-year vs. 30-year mortgages Adjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years. The main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't necessarily reflect this, though — in some cases, fixed rates are actually lower. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.) With an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year. But if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road. Learn more: Adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage First of all, now is a relatively good time to buy a house compared to the last couple of years. Home prices aren't spiking like they were during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. So, if you want or need to buy a house soon, you should feel pretty good about the current climate. Mortgage rates aren't predicted to fall drastically throughout 2025 like people were expecting a few months ago. Now could be just as good a time to buy as a couple of months from now. The best time to buy is typically whenever it makes sense for your stage of life. Trying to time the real estate market can be as futile as timing the stock market — buy when it's the right time for you. Read more: Which is more important, your home price or mortgage rate? According to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.59% right now. But keep in mind that averages can vary depending on where you live. For example, if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be higher. Mortgage rates are expected to decrease overall in 2025, though they will probably not significantly decrease anytime soon. No, mortgage rates have increased for three consecutive days. In many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.

I’m an Economist: Here’s My Prediction for the Housing Market During Trump’s Presidency,"Immediately after Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election, people began predicting how his next term would affect the markets, including the U.S. real estate landscape. Read Next: How Paychecks Would Look in Each State If Trump Dropped Federal Income Tax Try This: 7 Tax Loopholes the Rich Use To Pay Less and Build More Wealth The housing market often points to other economic issues, creating a domino effect for American homeowners. GOBankingRates put out the call to economists and real estate experts for their expert opinions on what might happen during Trump’s second term as president. According to Marty Harlee, president and CEO at First Trust Financial, Trump in office again means “we would see another massive refinance boom along with a record number of home sales.” He added, “I predict that Trump would definitely recommend to the Federal Reserve to lower the interest rates. He would recommend this because it is the best and most effective way to move the economy upward quickly — and our current market could certainly stand a boost. Lowering rates would move every other industry upward as well.” Harlee said this could extend to car sales and refinancing, home equity lines of credit and many other sectors of the economy. Check Out: 6 Bills That Could Skyrocket With Trump as President “Under a Trump presidency, economic policies would likely continue to emphasize deregulation and tax cuts, which could stimulate economic growth and potentially increase disposable income for many Americans,” said Dennis Shirshikov, a professor of finance, economics and accounting at the City University of New York. He predicted that this move could boost the housing market by increasing demand for homes. “For instance, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which Trump signed into law during his first term, led to an increase in after-tax income for many individuals and businesses, providing more capital for home purchases and investments in real estate,” Shirshikov explained. Harlee added, “Interest rates also affect the investment industry, in particular the S&P [500]. Donald Trump is real estate heavy in assets and will definitely try to take advantage of this while he is in office.” Kateryna Odarchenko, a political strategist who also holds a real estate license in Maryland, said, “The topics of housing and construction are increasingly significant in American politics. The rising cost of living and housing affordability are major concerns for many Americans, with inflation only worsening these issues. “Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign includes several initiatives related to the housing market and construction sector, building on the policies from his previous term. During his first term, Trump worked on increasing homeownership rates, extending eviction moratoriums during the pandemic, and proposing the privatization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.” She added, “These efforts have implications for future homebuyers and the housing market at large. His administration also introduced tax reforms such as ‘opportunity zones’ to stimulate investment in underdeveloped areas and capped property, income and sales tax deductions, affecting homeowners differently across the country.” When examining the possible negative impacts of reelecting Trump and how it would affect the real estate market, Harlee said, “The only downside to a second Trump term would be when rates do come back down, the price of housing will also increase and the supply of available housing will also decrease. In general, interest rates and the housing market always do well with Republicans in office.” That would mainly be reflected in interest rates and inflation, which are already key topics on voters’ minds when they cast their ballots for the next president of the United States. “While deregulation and tax cuts can stimulate economic activity, they can also lead to inflationary pressures,” Shirshikov said. “The Federal Reserve might respond by raising interest rates to control inflation, which could make mortgages more expensive and reduce housing affordability. Higher interest rates typically lead to higher monthly mortgage payments, which can deter potential homebuyers and slow down the housing market.” Shirshikov also noted, “Trump’s tenure was marked by significant market volatility, partly due to his unconventional approach to policy and communication. This unpredictability can create uncertainty in the housing market, causing potential buyers and investors to hesitate.” Odarchenko said, “I believe that affordable housing programs might be restructured, as this topic is more aligned with Democratic agendas, focusing on development around more diverse communities and promoting diversity.” Regarding the privatization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Odarchenko views “these as bold statements similar to the idea of the U.S. withdrawing from NATO. Therefore, I wouldn’t pay much attention to them as realistic outcomes. However, deregulation and the introduction of new tax programs are quite plausible.” Odarchenko pointed out that two of the main issues for Americans right now are the cost of living and housing affordability amid inflation. “Thus, the question of housing accessibility is one of the most important for both Democrats and Republicans,” she said. “Considering Trump’s work with developers and his overall background in real estate, these are positive developments for the market.” Under a Trump presidency, Shirshikov anticipates that “economic policies would likely continue to emphasize deregulation and tax cuts, which could stimulate economic growth and potentially increase disposable income for many Americans. This, in turn, could boost the housing market by increasing demand for homes.” On a similar note, Odarchenko summed up the notion that “the housing policies highlight the stark differences between the two major political parties. For many Americans, the issues of affordability and accessibility in housing will be decisive factors in the upcoming election.” Editor’s note on political coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

"Mortgage and refinance rates today, March 14, 2025: Rate is 10 basis points under 52-week average","Some advertisements and offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure. Mortgage interest rates barely budged this week, but they've still decreased over the last year. According to Freddie Mac, the current 30-year fixed rate is 6.65%, which is 10 basis points lower than the 52-week average. The 15-year fixed interest rate is 5.80%, down 17 basis points from the 52-week average. Now could be a good time to buy a house. It's unlikely that home loan rates will nosedive over the next few months. According to the CME FedWatch tool, there's a 97% chance that the Federal Reserve will keep the federal funds rate unchanged at its meeting next week. Rates may inch up or down in the coming weeks, but you probably shouldn't hold out for any drastic changes.

Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case. Learn more: Want to refinance your mortgage? Here are 7 home refinance options. Your mortgage rate plays a large role in how much your monthly payment will be. Other factors that impact your monthly payment are your down payment, which type of loan you get, and whether you need mortgage insurance. If you want to see how much house you can afford — regarding both home price and monthly payments — use our free Yahoo Finance home affordability calculator. A mortgage interest rate is a fee for borrowing money from your lender, expressed as a percentage. You can choose from two types of rates: fixed or adjustable. A fixed-rate mortgage locks in your rate for the entire life of your loan. For example, if you get a 30-year mortgage with a 6% interest rate, your rate will stay at 6% for the entire 30 years unless you refinance or sell. An adjustable-rate mortgage locks in your rate for a predetermined amount of time and then changes it periodically. Let’s say you get a 7/1 ARM with an introductory rate of 6%. Your rate would be 6% for the first seven years, then the rate would increase or decrease once per year for the last 23 years of your term. Whether your rate goes up or down depends on several factors, such as the economy and housing market. At the beginning of your mortgage term, most of your monthly payment goes toward interest. Your monthly payment toward mortgage principal and interest stays the same throughout the years — however, less and less of your payment goes toward interest, and more goes toward the mortgage principal or the amount you originally borrowed. Learn more: Adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgages A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is a good choice if you want a lower mortgage payment and the predictability that comes with having a fixed rate. Just know that your rate will be higher than if you choose a shorter term and will result in paying significantly more in interest over the years. You might like a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage if you want to pay off your home loan quickly and save money on interest. These shorter terms come with lower interest rates, and since you’re cutting your repayment time in half, you’ll save a lot in interest in the long run. But you’ll need to be sure you can comfortably afford the higher monthly payments that come with 15-year terms. Read more: How to decide between a 15-year and 30-year fixed-rate mortgage Typically, an adjustable-rate mortgage could be good if you plan to sell before the introductory rate period ends. Adjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, then your rate will change after a predetermined amount of time. However, 5/1 and 7/1 ARM rates have similar to (or even higher than) 30-year fixed rates recently. Before getting an ARM just for a lower rate, compare your rate options from term to term and lender to lender. According to Freddie Mac data, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate had decreased for seven weeks, and the 15-year rate for three weeks. Rates on both terms inched up this week — but barely. It's hard to know whether mortgage rates will stay low. There's a lot of economic uncertainty right now, and factors such as politics, inflation, and the federal funds rate could push rates up or down. Read more: When will the housing market crash again? According to Freddie Mac, the national average 30-year mortgage rate is up two basis points from last week to 6.65%, and the average 15-year mortgage rate has increased by one basis point to 5.80%. According to their February housing forecasts, the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) expects the 30-year mortgage rate to end 2025 at 6.50%, and Fannie Mae predicts it will land at 6.60%. Mortgage rates could increase here and there in 2025, but there's a good chance they will actually decrease by the end of the year.

"Compass is in talks to buy Buffett's real-estate brokerage unit, WSJ reports","(Reuters) -Home brokerage Compass is in advanced talks to acquire Warren Buffett's real-estate brokerage business, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. The acquisition price could not be determined, the report said, adding that a deal could come together soon if talks don't hit any last-minute snags. Compass and Berkshire Hathaway did not respond to a Reuters requests for comment. Earlier this week, Rocket Companies said it would acquire real estate listing platform Redfin in an all-stock deal valued at $1.75 billion, in a move to boost its lending business. Compass, which operates in 35 U.S. states and Washington DC, with more than 33,000 agents, is among the largest U.S. real estate brokerages by sales volume.

We're two of America's top real-estate agents. Here's where wealthy people are moving.,"Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes joined forces in 2005 and now run a team of about 100 real-estate agents. The team works from NYC to Miami and averaged $4 billion in annual sales over the last four years. Eklund and Gomes reflected on the power of social media in real estate and the next hot luxury market. This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with luxury real-estate agents Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes, who joined forces in 2005 and shot to fame on Bravo's reality show, ""Million Dollar Listing: New York."" Twenty years later, they oversee a team of about 100 agents at Douglas Elliman with Eklund Gomes team CEO Julia Spillman. The team recorded $3.77 billion in sales across New York, California, Florida, and Texas in 2023, the most recent year data is available. Notable past clients include ""Sex and the City"" actress Sarah Jessica Parker and Hollywood power couple Chrissy Teigen and John Legend. The conversation with Eklund and Gomes has been edited for length and clarity. John Gomes: We really are the yin and the yang. There are things that he's really good at that I'm just really bad at, and vice versa. Sometimes I get in my own head and think too much; Fredrik is a doer. Fredrik Eklund: I want everybody to be on my wavelength. When I get too intense, John can call me out. Gomes: Early on, before we started, Fredrik would say, ""Real estate can be a lonely business. Why don't we do it together?"" We get in ruts, and if you don't have someone to help you out, well, then you become a has-been. There are many of them in this industry. Gomes: I didn't even realize I was in a slump. A couple of months ago, Julia and Fredrik held basically, like, a crisis meeting. They're like, ""John, we don't know what's going on. You don't seem like yourself."" That heart-to-heart meant everything. It turned me around completely. Eklund: The biggest fight we've ever had was when I felt like there wasn't enough in his calendar. In retaliation, he completely removed his calendar so I didn't have visibility anymore. Gomes: I've never liked the idea of having to put every little thing on my calendar. I don't put everything in it, yet somehow I'm busy all day. We had a come-to-Jesus moment and Fredrik eventually said, ""Okay, I'm going to release you from the calendar."" We had to compromise. Eklund: Social media grew organically over the last 15 years, and it has become really important to the real-estate business. I remember when we first hired an in-house graphic designer, which gave us an opportunity to look different from other teams on social media. That became a powerful moment — when you could post photos of a listing and 100 agents would spread it across the world at the same time. Eklund: Social media gives me anxiety, to be honest with you. I'm not one of those people who love it. When you have millions of followers, there's pressure to post more and more. Looking into the future, I think it's about becoming more authentic — showing more vulnerability — and less bragging. I feel like that was also the case with reality TV back in the day. Eklund: I don't want to sound negative, because social media does bring us great success. How else do you get 500,000 or 1 million views on something for free? Globally and instantly, too. But when you have a team of 100 agents and 25 developers, it's hard. How do you keep your social media authentic? Eklund: I'm from Sweden. I worked in Singapore and Tokyo. I've lived in London in addition to New York. I feel like the world is a smorgasbord, as we say in Swedish. There are so many sandwiches I want to taste, and I don't have enough time. Gomes: During COVID, Florida went gangbusters and New York slowed down entirely. So if we were only in New York, we would have gone bust, but we were able to hedge. We boomed in Florida, and then that slowed down. It's always the hottest in one market, but that market is not always the hottest, right? Eklund: Nashville is definitely a luxury market on the rise. I'm studying right now to get my license in Tennessee, as we're seeing a lot of activity down there. Gomes: Typical buyers are coming from LA. They might have ties to the music industry. Eklund: Or they're New Yorkers relocating to Tennessee for tax reasons. Not everybody leaving New York wants Miami. Nashville has a real energy around it. Gomes: Twenty years ago, when we began this whole thing, I never in my wildest imagination thought we'd be here. I never imagined we'd have 100 people who work with us in five different states. Gomes: All I did was just work every day. Fredrik and I motivated each other. We were hungry, one day at time. One day, we woke up to find we were 38 on the Real Deal's list of top brokers in NYC and thought we were the best thing since sliced bread. It made us more hungry — we wanted to be No. 1. (Editor's note: The Eklund-Gomes team reached No. 1 on Real Deal's most list of top residential brokers in New York City. It most recently ranked third, with $260 million in NYC sales in 2023.) Gomes: Unfortunately, so many agents look at the leaders of the industry and they want that success right away. They want to do it fast. I think social media hurt young agents in many ways, because they think everything is supposed to happen super quickly. That was never our plan — the business evolved organically. Eklund: Find a group of people that you have fun with. Find a group of people who you are allowed to criticize and who criticize you and who grow with you. It's very much like a family or a marriage. Gomes: Don't think too much about the future. Don't lean into fears. Rather, allow it to propel you to success. It will take you very far.

"Average US rate on a 30-year mortgage edges higher, ending a seven-week slide","The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. edged higher this week, ending a seven-week slide that helped ease borrowing costs for home shoppers leading into the spring homebuying season. The rate averaged 6.65% this week, up from 6.63% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, it averaged 6.74%. Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners seeking to refinance their home loan to a lower rate, also ticked up this week. The average rate rose to 5.8% from 5.79% last week. A year ago, it averaged 6.16%, Freddie Mac said. Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including bond market investors’ expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy decisions. After climbing to just above 7% in mid-January, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage declined through last week, echoing moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans. The yield, which was approaching 4.8% in mid-January, has been mostly falling since then, reflecting worries about the economy’s growth and the fallout from the Trump administration’s decision to impose tariffs on imported goods from many of the nation's key trade partners. The yield was at 4.31% in midday trading Thursday. Tariffs can drive inflation higher, which could translate into higher yields on the 10-year Treasury note, pushing up mortgage rates. That’s because bond investors demand higher returns as long as inflation remains elevated. On Thursday, the Labor Department said that U.S. wholesale inflation last month was milder than economists expected. That followed a similarly encouraging report from the day before showing inflation at the consumer level slowed in February for the first time since September. Still, the Fed, which is scheduled to give its latest interest rate policy update next Wednesday, has signaled that it intends to take a more cautious approach as it gauges where inflation is headed and what impact the Trump administration's policies on trade, taxes and other fronts will have on the economy. So far, the pullback in rates hasn’t improved the affordability equation for many would-be homebuyers, keeping the housing market in a sales slump. Still, as rates have eased in recent weeks, more would-be homebuyers have been applying for a home loan. Last week, mortgage applications jumped 11.2% from the previous week and 31% compared to a year earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. And a measure of home loan refinancing applications surged 16%, the MBA said. While a pickup in mortgage applications is typical for this time of year, the sharp increase suggests the pullback in mortgage rates is encouraging would-be homebuyers. Home shoppers who can afford to buy at current home loan rates or to sidestep them entirely by paying cash also stand to benefit from a wider selection of properties on the market. The inventory of homes for sale has risen sharply from a year ago and prices are rising more slowly nationally and declining in many metropolitan areas, such as Austin, Dallas and Tampa, Florida. “The combination of modestly lower mortgage rates and improving inventory is a positive sign for homebuyers in this critical spring homebuying season,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.

Mortgage rates barely budge despite a wild week for financial markets,"Mortgage rates were little changed this week despite a steep stock market sell-off brought on by President Trump’s rapidly evolving tariff policies and retaliatory moves from trading partners. The average 30-year mortgage rate was 6.65% through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac data, nearly flat from 6.63% a week earlier. Fifteen-year mortgage rates also showed little movement, rising a single basis point to 5.8% from 5.79%. Although they snapped a seven-week streak of moving lower, mortgage rates remain around a three-month low, encouraging more buyers to enter the market. “Mortgage rates continue to be relatively low versus the last few months, and homebuyers have responded,” Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said in a statement. Read more: Mortgage and refinance rates today Mortgage demand is growing as the traditional spring homebuying season kicks off. Mortgage applications to purchase a home rose 7% through Friday from a week earlier, while refinancing applications jumped 16%, according to Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) data. The MBA expects mortgage demand to stay steady throughout the spring if rates continue to fall. Read more: Is it a good time to buy a house? ""Every bit that rates drop not only brings buyers to market, but it could potentially unlock sellers too,"" said Leo Pareja, chief executive officer of eXp Realty. Ten-year Treasury yields, which mortgage rates closely track, were volatile this week, falling steeply on Monday as jittery investors piled into safe-haven assets amid a 2.7% selloff in the S&P 500 (^GSPC). But they rose again after Trump implemented 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, walking back an earlier threat of a 50% levy, and Consumer Price Index data showed easing inflation in February.

What is the Amex trifecta? How to get more value from your Membership Rewards Points.,"Some advertisements and offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure. If you’re a fan of the American Express Membership Rewards program, you probably already know how valuable Amex points can be. A great Amex rewards card can offer plenty of annual savings for any budget. But if you really want to upgrade your rewards value — especially if you’re a frequent traveler with regular travel spending — you can use a specific trio of Amex cards to get the most from every dollar you spend. The Amex trifecta is made up of three American Express rewards cards: The Platinum Card® from American Express American Express® Gold Card The Blue Business® Plus Credit Card from American Express Together, these cards can offer even more dynamic savings on future travel, everyday spending, and more. Here’s more about the three cards that make up the Amex trifecta: Why we like it: The Platinum Card from Amex is one of the most premium rewards cards available today. Its only bonus categories are focused on travel, and you’ll get the best value if you’re willing to book through Amex Travel, the issuer’s travel portal. But the best feature of the Platinum Card is its benefits — specifically if you’re a frequent traveler. Amex says the Platinum Card offers over $1,500 in annual value with credits for hotel stays, airline fees, digital subscriptions, and much more. You’ll also get access to more than 1,400 airport lounges across the world (including Centurion Lounges) through Amex’s Global Lounge Collection. Read our full review of the Platinum Card from American Express. Why we like it: On its own, the Amex Gold offers incredible savings on everyday purchases, with an unbeatable 4x points at restaurants and U.S. supermarkets (up to limits). It also offers hundreds of dollars in value on purchases you can make at home or on the go, including dining and rideshare credits. In fact, the Amex Gold card is one of our best travel card picks from any issuer. As part of this Amex trifecta, it’s a great tool to supplement the Amex Platinum’s travel rewards and still earn plenty of points when you’re not traveling. If you’re able to max out the $25,000 annual spending cap for earning 4x at U.S. supermarkets, for example, you’d net 100,000 Membership Rewards Points each year — at a value of 1 cent per point, that could get you up to $1,000 in travel redemptions. Read our full American Express Gold Card review. Why we like it: The Amex Blue Business Plus Credit Card is the only business card in the trifecta, so you will need a business to qualify. You could be eligible whether you do freelance work, have a side gig, or you’re a brick-and-mortar small business owner. It’s a pretty straightforward no-annual-fee credit card (see rates & fees) on its own, with a solid 2x points on every purchase up to the first $50,000 annually, then 1x points. Beyond rewards, there are a few added benefits. But if you’re considering the Amex trifecta, the Blue Business Plus card adds a lot of flexibility. You can use this card for all of your non-bonus spending and get 2x points on each purchase until you meet the annual limit. If you max out the $50,000 spending cap, you could earn a total of 100,000 Membership Rewards Points with the card each year. Read our full review of the Blue Business Plus Credit Card from American Express. With the right strategy, you can make the most of each dollar you spend using the Amex trifecta. One of the main benefits of using the trifecta is the ability to get top rewards rates across a range of categories — so you’ll have more Amex Membership Rewards to redeem when you’re ready to book a trip. First, start with the Amex Platinum for your travel spending: 5x points on flights booked directly with airlines or AmexTravel.com (up to $500,000 per year), then 1x 5x points on eligible prepaid hotels booked through AmexTravel.com If you spend beyond the $500,000 max on eligible flights in a calendar year with your Amex Platinum, you can still use your Amex Gold to earn an unlimited 3x points on flights booked directly with airlines or through AmexTravel.com. The Amex Gold card can cover some additional travel methods, too: 3x points on other eligible travel (prepaid car rentals, prepaid cruise reservations) booked through AmexTravel.com with Amex Gold Beyond travel, look to Amex Gold for the best rewards on groceries and dining out: 4x points at restaurants worldwide (up to $50,000 spent per year), then 1x 4x points at U.S. supermarkets (up to $25,000 spent per year), then 1x For all other expenses, you’ll get bonus points with the Blue Business Plus card at its flat rewards rate: 2x points on all other purchases (up to $50,000 spent per year), then 1x This includes all of your regular purchases that don’t fall into the above bonus categories — gas or EV charging, utility payments, tourist attractions, event and concert tickets, online shopping, and more — up to the annual limit. If you have a large budget, it can also include spending across otherwise eligible bonus categories after you max out those annual spending caps. The other major component of the Amex trifecta that makes it worthwhile for travelers is all the added benefits* and annual credits. Most of your annual perks will come from the Amex Platinum card — especially for travel. This card is loaded with everything from airport lounge access to airline fee credits, credits for airport security programs (like TSA PreCheck and Clear), and more. Plus, you’ll get automatic elite status with a few partner travel brands: Marriott Bonvoy Gold Elite Status; Hilton Honors Gold Status; and premium status with Avis, Hertz, and National car rental companies. You’ll get some travel benefits with the Amex Gold card, too. But like its rewards, this card’s most valuable perks are on food spending. You can get over $300 in annual value just from various Amex Gold dining credits: Up to $84 in statement credits ($7 per month, with enrollment) at U.S. Dunkin’ locations Up to $100 in statement credits ($50 semi-annually, with enrollment) when you dine at U.S. Resy restaurants or make other eligible purchases with Resy Up to $120 in statement credits ($10 per month, with enrollment) at participating dining partners including Grubhub, The Cheesecake Factory, Goldbelly, Wine.com, and Five Guys Another major benefit of both cards is annual Uber Cash** for food delivery or rideshares. Here’s the breakdown of the combined $320 you can use toward Uber spending each year with both the Amex Platinum and Amex Gold: Up to $200 Uber Cash ($15 per month and a bonus $20 in December) with the Amex Platinum Up to $120 Uber Cash ($10 per month) with Amex Gold *Terms apply for each of these American Express card benefits; many also require enrollment. Make sure you check your card’s terms and your online account for specific benefit offers.**To receive this benefit you must have downloaded the latest version of the Uber app and your eligible American Express Platinum Card or American Express Gold Card must be selected as the payment method. The Amex benefit may only be used in the United States. You can get a lot of potential value with the Amex trifecta, but it will take some effort to figure out where and how to make each purchase. For example, many of these cards’ top reward categories have annual spending caps; after you meet these maximums, you’ll earn just 1x point per dollar in the category. If you’re a big annual spender (or even think you could get close to a category’s spending max), it’s important to track when you’re approaching the cap. Benefits also require some strategizing. These card perks are incredibly valuable, but they can also be difficult to keep up with. Some renew each month, some are semi-annual, and some reset once per calendar year. Ensure you track your benefits on your own or within the Amex app regularly. Always remember to keep your card statements and monthly payments organized, too. The quickest way to lose reward value is by accruing interest charges on a card balance. Know your due dates and track your spending so you can pay on time and in full each month to avoid interest and fees. Related: A complete list of credit card perks that reset every year These cards can save you a lot of money on travel and other expenses, but they also come at a cost: The Platinum Card has a $695 annual fee (see rates & fees), the Amex Gold has a $325 annual fee (see rates & fees), and the Blue Business Plus (see rates & fees) has no annual fee. Altogether, that’s $1,020 in annual fees for the three cards. No matter your budget, spending over $1,000 in annual fees is a high price to pay. If you travel often and spend a lot of money in the eligible rewards categories, it is possible to make up that cost. Just make sure you compare your own potential value based on your spending before you apply. Related: Are credit cards with annual fees worth it? Great welcome offers: Each of these cards offers valuable welcome bonuses for new cardholders. Make sure you time your applications so you can both meet the spending thresholds within the given time periods (without overspending) and minimize any effects on your credit score. Valuable points: With the Amex trifecta, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to maximize the points you earn when spending across multiple categories. When it’s time to redeem your rewards, you can choose between multiple options within the Membership Rewards program, including booking flights through AmexTravel.com or transferring points to Amex’s airline and hotel transfer partners. Read more: Today’s top credit card sign-up bonuses High annual fees: The annual fees you’ll pay for the Amex trifecta are pricey. While you may be able to easily recoup that cost through rewards and benefits, you’ll still pay a lot of money each year to keep these cards. Make sure you look at how you spend and travel before you apply to ensure this card strategy is right for you. Other card combinations may work better for you: The Amex trifecta isn’t the only option for combining rewards cards to maximize your earnings. If these reward categories and benefits don’t align with how you already like to travel and where you spend money, another card combination may work better for your financial goals. Related: How to harness the power of the Chase trifecta The Amex trifecta can be a great solution for fans of American Express Membership Rewards. You can use the different reward categories and benefits to maximize your points and save money at home and abroad. But first, decide whether this card strategy fits with how you already travel. If you don’t use the services included in the cards’ annual benefits or you prefer to book travel outside of the eligible bonus categories, you may not get the best value with these cards. Also, remember that one of the cards in this trifecta is a business card, which may not work for you if you cannot qualify. Instead of the Blue Business Plus, you could keep your trifecta to all consumer cards and choose the American Express® Green Card. This card isn’t quite the catch-all you’ll get with the Blue Business Plus, but you can diversify your rewards a bit with 3x points on transit (including trains, rideshares, tolls, parking, buses, and more) as well as an additional annual credit for Clear Plus membership (up to $199 in statement credits, subject to auto-renewal). Before you apply for any new rewards card — or decide to use a card combination like the Amex trifecta — always look back at your regular spending habits and redemptions. With the right cards for your budget, spending, and travel preferences, you can ensure you make the most of your rewards now and in the future.

"How to save $10,000 in 6 months​","Some advertisements and offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure. What would you do with an extra $10,000? That amount of money could help you pay off debt, grow your emergency fund, cover a home repair, take a luxe vacation, or make progress toward any major financial goal. Ten thousand dollars can go a long way, but saving that much requires serious focus. If saving $10,000 feels unattainable, you’re not alone: According to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances, the median balance of American families’ transaction accounts was $8,000 in 2022. However, saving $10,000 isn’t impossible, and with a few strategic changes, you may be able to save $10,000 in six months. Saving $10,000 in six months breaks down to $1,667 per month. Depending on your income and financial responsibilities, this may not be realistic (though you may surprise yourself!). If saving $10,000 seems insurmountable, you can adjust your six-month savings goal to something more manageable. Below, find five tips to help you save $10,000 — or any amount — in six months. When you have a savings goal with a short-term deadline, you can accelerate your progress by limiting your monthly spending. Living on a bare-bones budget isn’t sustainable long term, which is why this strategy only works for a short period of time. But if you can cut back for six months (or even a couple of months), your savings can really take off. Start by reviewing your budget, bank statements, and credit card statements to see where your money goes each month. Then, identify places where you can cut back. You may decide to eliminate some expenses entirely; maybe you want to pause your gym membership, get rid of streaming services, or give up live sporting events for the season. Next, shift your focus to the necessary expenses, trimming them down where possible. For example: Use a grocery list and coupons to cut down on food spending Dine out half as often as you typically do Limit clothes shopping to thrift and consignment stores Call your internet and phone providers to negotiate your bills Plan a free or low-cost activity for loved ones’ birthdays instead of springing for a pricey gift Read more: How to save money in 2025: 50 tips to grow your wealth If you’re like many people, you have clutter accumulating in your home. And chances are, there are some valuable items hidden among the mess. Instead of letting this stuff take up space, consider selling it. Declutter your house room by room, keeping an eye out for things you can sell. Use the following list to guide your search: Clothes, shoes, and accessories Books Art and home decor Kitchen gadgets and appliances Craft supplies Sports equipment Kids’ toys Electronics Furniture Bikes and outdoor equipment Once you’ve collected any items you’re ready to sell, decide how you’ll do it. Options include hosting a garage sale or posting items on sites like Facebook Marketplace, Poshmark, Craigslist, or eBay. Alternatively, you may be able to sell certain items — like clothes and furniture — at consignment shops as long as they’re in good condition. Cutting your expenses can be an effective way to save, but it’s worth looking at the other side of the equation: your income. First, find out if you can get paid more in your current role. Is it time to negotiate a raise? Are you able to earn more money at another company or in a different industry? If you work hourly, can you work a few extra hours each week? While you don’t need to make a dramatic career change, it’s worth finding out if there’s potential to earn more. Next, consider a side hustle. While an additional gig may be unsustainable in the long run, it can be a valuable short-term strategy to build your savings quickly. There are plenty of side hustle options out there, whether you want to run your own business or work a part-time job. Here are some ideas to get you thinking: Drive for a rideshare company House- or pet-sit Offer consulting services Sell homemade products on Etsy Become a virtual assistant Whether you get a raise at work or take on a side hustle, you’ll be well on your way to reaching your six-month savings goal. Even earning an extra $500 per month would add up to $3,000 in six months, putting a significant dent in your $10,000 goal. If you’ve spent any time perusing blogs or social media for savings tips, you may have come across various “savings challenges.” While there are endless variations of these challenges, the idea is the same: to gamify the process of saving. Doing so not only makes saving more fun, but it can also make it easier to focus on your goal. Savings challenges might be structured in one of the following ways: Saving a specific amount of money: saving $100 per week, saving $1,000 in a month, etc. Reducing spending in certain areas: no discretionary spending for a weekend, no subscriptions for a month, no dining out for a week, etc. Stepping up your savings: increasing the amount you save by 1% each week You can also create your own spending challenge based on your lifestyle or habits. For example, if you’re a frequent customer at the local coffee shop, you could commit to saving $1 for every $1 you spend on coffee. Regardless of the challenge you choose, create clear parameters, set a reasonable goal, and reward yourself when you achieve it. Earning income in exchange for your hard work is gratifying, but it never hurts to earn passive income too. Keeping your savings in a high-yield savings account (HYSA) can help give your balance an extra boost. High-yield savings accounts work like any other savings account, but they earn higher interest rates compared to traditional accounts. Online banks typically offer these accounts because they don’t have the cost of maintaining physical branches. Instead, they can pass on savings to customers in the form of higher interest rates. Today, the best high-yield savings accounts earn more than 4% APY — roughly 10 times the national average savings account rate of 0.41%. Meanwhile, some of the country’s biggest banks offer just 0.01%. Read more: The 10 best high-yield savings accounts available today The following table shows how much you could earn if you deposited $5,000 in a savings account, and then made an additional $1,000 contribution each month for six months: As you can see, putting your money in a high-yield savings account won’t grow your balance by thousands of dollars in just a few months — but it will allow you to maximize your returns on that money without having to do any extra work. After opening a high-yield account, set up automatic transfers from your checking account into your new savings account. This step ensures you’re progressing toward your savings goal whether or not you’re consciously thinking about it. Saving $10,000 in six months is definitely possible, but it may not be easy or immediately attainable for everyone. To save $10,000 in six months, you need to save roughly $1,667 per month, or about $385 per week. Cutting back on spending, increasing your income, selling items around your house, trying various savings challenges, and depositing your money into a high-yield savings account can all help you reach your goal.

An AI imaging firm says Johnson & Johnson stole its tech. Execs on both sides are expected to testify next week.,"Johnson & Johnson executives are scheduled to take the stand in a trial starting Monday. ChemImage, a small biotech firm, sued the healthcare giant over a 2019 partnership that went south. Johnson & Johnson had signed a multibillion-dollar contract with the Pittsburgh-based company. In 2019, Johnson & Johnson, hoping to compete in the growing surgical robotics field, signed a multibillion-dollar contract with a small biotech company called ChemImage. Based in Pittsburgh, ChemImage was pioneering AI-powered software that a surgeon could use in order to ""see"" what a robotic scalpel is doing. The images would help the surgeon form real-time assessments of damaged or cancerous tissue. On Monday, these former partners — the small biotech company and the global healthcare giant — are set to face off in federal court in Manhattan at a trial over a $1.5 billion breach of contract lawsuit ChemImage filed last spring. US District Judge Jesse Furman, who will preside over the weeklong bench trial, has since trimmed the allowable damages. If ChemImage prevails, it could win some $180 million in contract-termination penalties and other overdue payments. ChemImage has also asked the judge to restore all patents and intellectual property it developed under its contract with Johnson & Johnson. This would let the plaintiffs continue using and developing its imaging software. ""This is a case about J&J's decision to retreat from its failed play in surgical robotics, breaking the promises it made to ChemImage to develop its life-saving imaging technology,"" the lawsuit alleges. ""J&J's decision ultimately killed this family-founded company and its technology that could have vastly improved surgical outcomes for millions of people."" What's undisputed is that two days after Christmas in 2019, ChemImage and the J&J subsidiary Ethicon entered into a 104-page ""Research, Development, License, and Commercialization Agreement."" The contract set a payment schedule — ChemImage received $7 million up front — and established milestones for future payments and as much as $1.5 billion in eventual royalties. Also undisputed is that in April 2023 — with the effort to meld ChemImage's software and J&J's robotics mired in delay and no commercially viable product in sight — the contract blew up. The judge is tasked with determining whether J&J pulled the contract for good reason — ""with cause."" If so, ChemImage would be entitled to no damages at all. Alternately, if J&J pulled the contract for no valid reason — without cause — the healthcare company would have been required to give ChemImage a 120-day notice and a $40 million termination payment, neither of which happened. ChemImage also alleges that an additional $140 million in incremental development ""milestone"" payments are due. Much of the testimony will involve opposing accounts of why the partnership went south after three years. J&J will present witnesses to show that the contract was terminated for cause, and so ChemImage does not deserve damages. In court papers, they allege that ChemImage failed to meet more than one developmental milestone after more than two years of work, and caused significant cost overruns. ""Plaintiff was harmed as a result of its own conduct,"" J&J's lawyers wrote in January. ChemImage counters in court papers that the delays were caused by issues with Ethicon's own technology, employee turnover, and lack of engagement. Nine current and former J&J executives are on the parties' witness lists, including Hani Abouhalka, the surgery chairman for the MedTech division, and Rocco De Bernardis, the global president of robotic and digital surgery. Peter Shen, the MedTech division's former global head of research, is also on the list. ChemImage is also expected to call many of its own former executives, including its former CEO, Dr. Jeffrey Cohen.

"Starship, carrying Tesla's bot, set for Mars by end-2026: Elon Musk","(Reuters) - SpaceX founder Elon Musk said on Friday that Starship is set to depart for Mars at the end of next year, carrying Tesla humanoid bot Optimus. Musk suggested in a post on X that human landings could begin as early as 2029, though 2031 was more likely if the initial landings go well. Musk told investors on a conference call in April last year that he expected Optimus would be able to perform tasks in the factory by the end of 2024. In November, Reuters cited sources saying that Musk's dream of transporting humans to Mars would become a bigger national priority under U.S. President Donald Trump, signalling big changes for NASA's moon programme and a boost for SpaceX. Starship is crucial to SpaceX's future satellite launch business, a sector it currently dominates with its partially reusable Falcon 9, as well as Musk's aspirations to colonise Mars.

"The list of major companies laying off staff this year, including Porsche, Wayfair, Starbucks, and Meta","Companies such as Meta, Microsoft, BlackRock, and Chevron are conducting layoffs. Artificial intelligence is reshaping some workforces. See the list of companies letting workers go in 2025. Layoffs and other workforce reductions are continuing in 2025, following two years of significant job cuts across tech, media, finance, manufacturing, retail, and energy. While the reasons for slimming staff vary, the cost-cutting measures are coming amid a backdrop of technological change. In a recent World Economic Forum survey, some 41% of companies worldwide said they expected to reduce their workforces over the next five years because of the rise of artificial intelligence. Companies such as CNN, Dropbox, and IBM have previously announced job cuts related to AI. Tech jobs in big data, fintech, and AI are meanwhile expected to double by 2030, according to the WEF. Here are the companies with job cuts planned or already underway in 2025 so far. Adidas plans to cut up to 500 jobs in Germany. Adidas said in January that it would reduce the size of its workforce at its headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany, impacting up to 500 jobs, CNBC reported. If fully executed, it amounts to a reduction of nearly 9% at the company headquarters, which employs about 5,800 employees, according to the Adidas website. The news came shortly after the company announced it had outperformed its profit expectations at the end of 2024, touting ""better-than-expected"" results in the fourth quarter. ""Strong growth across all regions and divisions proves the good job our teams are doing across regions and functions,"" CEO Bjørn Gulden said in a press release. ""So although we are not yet where we want to be long term, I am very happy with this development which was much better than we had expected."" In a statement to BI, an Adidas spokesperson said the company had grown ""too complex because of our current operating model."" ""To set adidas up for long-term success,"" the spokesperson said, ""we are now starting to look at how we align our operating model with the reality of how we work. This may have an impact on the organizational structure and number of roles based at our HQ in Herzogenaurach."" The company said it is not a cost-cutting measure and that it could not confirm concrete numbers. Ally is cutting less than 5% of workers. The digital-financial-services company Ally is laying off roughly 500 of its 11,000 employees, a spokesperson confirmed to BI. ""As we continue to right-size our company, we made the difficult decision to selectively reduce our workforce in some areas, while continuing to hire in our other areas of our business,"" the spokesperson said. The spokesperson also said the company was offering severance, out-placement support, and the opportunity to apply for openings at Ally. Ally made a similar level of cuts in October 2023, the Charlotte Observer reported. BlackRock is cutting 1% of its workforce. BlackRock told employees it was planning to cut about 200 people of its 21,000-strong workforce, Bloomberg reported in January. The reductions were more than offset by some 3,750 workers who were added last year and another 2,000 expected to be added in 2025. BlackRock's president, Rob Kapito, and its chief operating officer, Rob Goldstein, said the cuts would help realign the firm's resources with its strategy, Bloomberg reported. Blue Origin Jeff Bezos's rocket company, Blue Origin, is laying off about 10% of its workforce, a move that could affect more than 1,000 employees. In a memo sent to staff in February and obtained by Business Insider, David Limp, the CEO of Blue Origin, said the company's priority going forward was ""to scale our manufacturing output and launch cadence with speed, decisiveness and efficiency for our customers."" Limp specifically identified roles in engineering, research and development, and management as targets. ""We grew and hired incredibly fast in the last few years, and with that growth came more bureaucracy and less focus than we needed,"" Limp wrote. ""It also became clear that the makeup of our organization must change to ensure our roles are best aligned with executing these priorities."" The news comes after last month's debut launch of the company's partially reusable rocket — New Glenn. Boeing cut 400 roles from its moon rocket program Boeing announced on February 8 it plans to cut 400 roles from its moon rocket program amid delays and rising costs related to NASA's Artemis moon exploration missions. Artemis 2, a crewed flight to orbit the moon on Boeing's space launch system, has been re-scheduled from late 2024 to September 2025. Artemis 3, intended to be the first astronaut moon landing in the program, was delayed from late 2025 and is now planned for September 2026. ""To align with revisions to the Artemis program and cost expectations, we informed our Space Launch Systems team of the potential for approximately 400 fewer positions by April 2025,"" a Boeing spokesperson told Business Insider. ""We are working with our customer and seeking opportunities to redeploy employees across our company to minimize job losses and retain our talented teammates."" The company will issue 60-day notices of involuntary layoff to impacted employees ""in coming weeks,"" the spokesperson said earlier this month. Boeing cut 10% of its workforce last year. BP slashed 7,700 staff and contractor positions worldwide. BP told Business Insider in January that it planned to cut 4,700 staff and 3,000 contractors, amounting to about 5% of its global workforce. The cuts were part of a program to ""simplify and focus"" BP that began last year. ""We are strengthening our competitiveness and building in resilience as we lower our costs, drive performance improvement and play to our distinctive capabilities,"" the company said. Bridgewater cut about 90 staff. Bridgewater Associates cut 7% of its staff in January in an effort to stay lean, a person familiar with the matter told Business Insider. The layoffs at the world's largest hedge fund bring its head count back to where it was in 2023, the person said. The company's founder, Ray Dalio, said in a 2019 interview that about 30% of new employees were leaving the firm within 18 months. Chevron is slashing up to 20% of its global headcount Oil giant Chevron plans to cull 15% to 20% of its global workforce by the end of 2026, the company said in a statement to Business Insider in February. Chevron employed 45,600 people as of December 2023, which means the layoff could cut 9,000 jobs. The move aims to reduce costs and simplify the company's business as it completes its acquisition of oil producer Hess, which is held up in legal limbo. It is expected to save the company $2 billion to $3 billion by the end of 2026, the company said. ""Chevron is taking action to simplify our organizational structure, execute faster and more effectively, and position the company for stronger long-term competitiveness,"" a Chevron spokesperson said in a statement. The cuts follow a series of layoffs at other oil and gas companies, including BP and natural gas producer EQT. CNN plans to cut 200 jobs. Cable news giant CNN cut about 200 television-focused roles as part of a digital pivot. The cuts amounted to about 6% of the company's workforce. In a memo sent to staff on January 23, CNN's CEO Mark Thompson said he aimed to ""shift CNN's gravity towards the platforms and products where the audience themselves are shifting and, by doing that, to secure CNN's future as one of the world's greatest news organizations."" Estée Lauder will cut as many as 7,000 jobs Cosmetics giant Estée Lauder said in its second-quarter earnings release on February 4 that it will cut between 5,800 and 7,000 jobs as the company restructures over the next two years. The cuts will focus on ""rightsizing"" certain teams, and it will look to outsource certain services. The company says it expects annual gross benefits of between $0.8 billion and $1.0 billion before tax. HPE is laying off 2,500 employees Hewlett Packard Enterprise is cutting 2,500 jobs, or 5% of its employee base, CEO Antonio Neri said on an earnings call on March 6. The cuts are expected take to take place over the next 12 to 18 months. ""Doing so will better align our cost structure to our business mix and long-term strategy,"" Neri said. The company expects to save $350 million by 2027 because of the reduction. HPE plummeted about 20% after hours on March 6 after it said business would be affected by recent tariffs, slow server and cloud sales, and ""execution issues."" Johns Hopkins Johns Hopkins University will cut over 2,000 jobs after losing $800 million in funding from USAID. ""This is a difficult day for our entire community,"" a spokesperson told BI. ""The termination of more than $800 million in USAID funding is now forcing us to wind down critical work here in Baltimore and internationally."" The news comes after the Trump administration slashed USAID personnel down from over 10,000 to around 300. Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently confirmed that 83% of the agency's programs are now dead. ""We can confirm that the elimination of foreign aid funding has led to the loss of 1,975 positions in 44 countries internationally and 247 in the United States in the affected programs,"" the Johns Hopkins spokesperson said. ""An additional 29 international and 78 domestic employees will be furloughed with a reduced schedule."" The layoffs at Johns Hopkins represent the ""largest"" in the University's history, CNN reported. They'll primarily affect the schools of medicine and public health, along with the Center for Communication Programs and Jhpiego, a nonprofit with a focus on preventing diseases and bolstering women's health, according to the report. Kohl's is reducing about 10% of its roles Department store Kohl's announced on January 28 that it reduced about 10% of its corporate roles to ""increase efficiencies"" and ""improve profitability for the long-term health and benefit of the business,"" a spokesperson told BI. ""Kohl's reduced approximately 10 percent of the roles that report into its corporate offices,"" the spokesperson said. ""More than half of the total reduction will come from closing open positions while the remainder of the positions were currently held by our associates."" Less than 200 existing employees of the company would be impacted, she added. This follows the company's announcement on January 9 that it would shutter 27 underperforming stores across 15 states by April. The retailer has been struggling with declining sales, reporting an 8.8% decline in net sales in the third quarter of 2024. Its previous CEO, Tom Kingsbury, stepped down on January 15. The company's board appointed Ashley Buchanan, a retail veteran who had held top jobs in The Michaels Companies, Macy's, and Walmart, as the new CEO. Meta is cutting 5% of its workforce. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told staff he ""decided to raise the bar on performance management"" and will act quickly to ""move out low-performers,"" according to an internal memo seen by BI in January. Those cuts started this month, according to records obtained by BI. Teams overseeing Facebook, the Horizon virtual reality platform, as well as logistics were among the hardest hit. Previously, the company had laid off more than 21,000 workers since 2022. Microchip Technology is slashing 2,000 jobs Microchip Technology is cutting its head count across the company by around 2,000 employees, the semiconductor company said on March 3. The company estimated that it would incur between $30 million and $40 million in costs, including severance, severance benefits, and other restructuring costs. The cuts would be communicated to employees in the March quarter and fully implemented by the end of the June quarter. Last year, Microchip announced it was closing its Tempe, Arizona, facility because of slower-than-anticipated orders. The closure begins in May 2025 and is expected to affect 500 jobs. Microchip's stock had fallen over 33% in the past year. Microsoft made performance-based job cuts in January Microsoft cut an unspecified number of jobs in January based on employees' performance. Workers were told that they wouldn't receive severance and that their benefits, such as medical insurance, would stop immediately, BI reported. The company also laid off some employees in January at divisions including gaming and sales. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to say how many jobs were cut on the affected teams. Porsche is cutting 3,900 jobs over the next few years Porsche said on March 12 that it plans to cut 3,900 jobs in the coming years. About 2,000 of the reductions will come with the expiration of fixed-term contractor positions, the German automaker said Wednesday. The company will make the other 1,900 reductions by 2029 through natural attrition and limiting hiring, it said. Porsche said it also plans to discuss more potential changes with labor leaders in the second half of the year. ""This will also make Porsche even more efficient in the medium and long term,"" the company said. Salesforce is cutting more than 1,000 jobs Bloomberg reported in February that Salesforce, a cloud-based customer management software company, will slash more than 1,000 jobs from its nearly 73,000-strong workforce. Affected employees will be eligible to apply to open internal roles, the outlet reported. The company is currently hiring salespeople focused on the company's new AI-powered products. The cuts come despite Salesforce reporting a strong financial performance during its third-quarter earnings in December. Representatives for Salesforce did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Sonos cuts about 200 jobs Sonos, a California-based audio equipment company, said in a February 5 release that it's cutting about 200 roles. The announcement came nearly a month after Sonos CEO Patrick Spence stepped down from his position following a disastrous app rollout. The company's interim CEO Tom Conrad said in the statement that the layoff was part of an effort to create a ""simpler organization."" ""One thing I've observed first hand is that we've become mired in too many layers that have made collaboration and decision-making harder than it needs to be,"" Conrad said. ""So across the company today we are reorganizing into flatter, smaller, and more focused teams."" Southwest Airlines Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan announced in February that the company is laying off 15% of its corporate staff, or about 1,750 employees. He said impacted workers will keep their pay, benefits, and bonuses through late April, when the separations will take effect. The company told investors the cuts would provide a ""partial year 2025 savings to be approximately $210 million and full-year 2026 savings to be approximately $300 million."" The move comes as Southwest tries to cut costs amid profitability problems. Jordan said this is the first significant layoff the company has had in its 53-year history. An activist hedge fund took a stake in Southwest in June and has since helped restructure its board and change its business model to keep up with a changing industry. For example, it plans to end its long-standing open-seating policy to generate more seating revenue. In recent months, the company has also reduced flight crew positions in Atlanta to cut costs. Starbucks is laying off 1,100 corporate staff. Starbucks will notify 1,100 corporate employees that they have been laid off on February 25. CEO Brian Niccol said in a memo that the layoffs will make Starbucks ""operate more efficiently, increase accountability, reduce complexity and drive better integration."" The layoffs won't affect employees at Starbucks stores, the company said. Niccol told employees that layoffs were on the way in a separate memo in January. The company is trying to improve results after sales slid last year. Stripe laid off 300 employees. Payments platform Stripe laid off 300 employees, primarily in product, engineering, and operations, according to a January 20 memo obtained by BI. Chief People Officer Rob McIntosh said in the memo that the company still planned on growing its head count to about 10,000 employees by the end of the year. The Washington Post cut 4% of its non-newsroom workforce. The Washington Post eliminated less than 100 employees in an effort to cut costs, Reuters reported in January. A spokesperson told the wire service that the changes would occur across multiple areas of the business and indicated that the cuts wouldn't affect the newsroom. ""The Washington Post is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry, build a more sustainable future and reach audiences where they are,"" the spokesperson said, according to Reuters. Wayfair laid off 340 tech employees Wayfair announced in an SEC filing on March 7 that it would eliminate its Austin Technology Development Center and lay off around 340 tech workers. The reorg comes as the technology team has accomplished ""significant modernization and replatforming milestones,"" the company said in the filing. Wayfair said it plans to refocus resources and streamline operations to promote its ""next phase of growth."" ""With the foundation of this transformation now in place, our technology needs have shifted,"" the company said. Wayfair expects to take on $33 to $38 million in costs as a result of the reorganization, consisting of severance, cash employee-related costs, benefits, and transitional costs. Workday cut more than 8% of its workforce Workday, the human-resources software company, said in February that it is cutting 8.5% of its workforce, or around 1,750 employees. The layoffs came as the company focuses more on artificial intelligence. In a note to employees, CEO Carl Eschenbach said that Workday will focus on hiring in areas related to artificial intelligence and work to expand its global presence. ""The environment we're operating in today demands a new approach, particularly given our size and scale,"" Eschenbach wrote. He said that affected employees will get at least 12 weeks of pay.

Crypto Currents: Binance founder denies report on Trump talks,"As bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies get increasing attention from investors, Wall Street and its traditional banks continue to adjust to the shift. Catch up on this week’s top stories highlighting the intersection of these old guard and new school areas of finance with this recap compiled by The Fly. Easily identify stocks' risks and opportunities. Discover stocks' market position with detailed  competitor analyses. BINANCE FOUNDER DENIES REPORT ON TRUMP TALKS: On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal’s Rebecca Ballhaus, Patricia Kowsmann, Angus Berwick, Josh Dawsey and Caitlin Ostroff reported that representatives of President crypto exchange Binance, citing people familiar with the matter. Binance’s billionaire founder, Changpeng Zhao, who served four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating anti-money-laundering requirements, has been pushing for the Trump administration to grant him a pardon, sources added. Following the report, Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance and its ex-CEO, stated in a post to X: “Sorry to disappoint. The WSJ article got the facts wrong. More than 20 people have told me they were asked by the WSJ (and another media), ‘Can you confirm that CZ made some deal for a pardon?’ They probably asked hundreds of people to have 20 people reach out to me. In essence, they tried hard to make a story to report. Fact: I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with … well, anyone. No felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in US history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single BSA charge. Feels like the article is motivated as an attack on the President and crypto, and the residual forces of the ‘war on crypto’ from the last administration are still at work. I am always happy to make crypto great everywhere, US and the rest of the world. It’s good to see that even WSJ thinks I should be pardoned.” COINBASE SECURES REGISTRATION IN INDIA: Coinbase (COIN) announced Tuesday it has registered with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit, which marks a significant milestone in its international expansion strategy. The company plans to launch its initial retail services later this year, followed by additional investment and products in India thereafter. “We’re committed to building in markets that believe in the potential of crypto and onchain innovation,” said John O’Loghlen, Regional Managing Director for APAC at Coinbase. “India represents one of the most exciting market opportunities in the world today, and we’re proud to deepen our investment here in full compliance with local regulations.” Additionally on Tuesday, Mizuho lowered the firm’s price target on Coinbase to $217 from $280 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. The firm said that since its last model update on February 20, the price of bitcoin has fallen from $98,000 to $79,000 and Coinbase shares are down 30%. While some multiple compression is warranted due to lower multiples across technology, the move in Coinbase shares is overdone, the analyst said. Mizuho believes the stock should trade closer to $217. While it sees some upside from here, it remains Neutral given the longer-term risk of pricing pressure from increased competition across the crypto trading space. Mizuho cited lower market multiples for the target cut. BIT DIGITAL REPORTS FY24 RESULTS: On Friday, Bit Digital (BTBT) reported FY24 earnings per share of 19c on revenue of $108.1M, which compared to a loss per share of (16c) on revenue of $44.9M last year. The company earned 949.9 bitcoins during 2024, a 37% decrease from the prior year, and treasury holdings of BTC and ETH were 741.9 and 27,623.2, respectively, with a fair market value of approximately $69.3M and $92.1M on December 31, respectively. The company said, “2024 marked a pivotal shift for Bit Digital. Our business was historically driven by digital asset mining, but the successful launch and rapid expansion of our HPC business fundamentally reshaped our company. This evolution drove over 140% revenue growth, with these new business lines contributing nearly half of total revenue. A defining milestone in this transformation was our acquisition of Enovum Data Centers in October. More than just an infrastructure expansion, Enovum provided us with a proven team, operational expertise, and a scalable platform to develop and operate data centers. It also introduced colocation services as a new business line, further diversifying our revenue streams and strengthening our AI compute capabilities. Bitcoin mining remained a key revenue contributor, generating $58.6M, a 32% increase year-over-year. However, as our HPC business scaled, mining’s share of total revenue declined to 54% in 2024, and further to 40% in Q424, compared to 98% in 2023. This shift underscores our strategic pivot toward infrastructure-driven revenue streams while maintaining disciplined mining operations.” ANALYSTS UPDATES BITCOIN MINER MODELS: On Thursday, JPMorgan downgraded Cipher Mining (CIFR) to Neutral from Overweight without a price target. The firm updated bitcoin miner price targets and models to reflect the Q4 results and changes in bitcoin price and the network hash rate. The firm now sees less upside potential relative to peers for Cipher Mining shares. Cipher could sign a high performance compute deal at its Barber Lake site, which could drive upside, but deals can take up to nine months to negotiate and finalize, the analyst said. JPMorgan also lowered the firm’s price target on Mara Holdings (MARA) to $18 from $23 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares as well as on CleanSpark (CLSK) to $12 from $17 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares and on Riot Platforms (RIOT) to $13 from $16 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. Additionally, the firm upgraded IREN (IREN) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $12, down from $15. JPMorgan named IREN its top pick citing the company’s “strong” mining operations and high performance computing “optionality.” The shares have “been overly punished” year-to-date, and offer 70% upside at current levels, which could prove conservative if IREN announces an HPC deal with a name-brand tenant, the analyst said. HIVE PRICE TARGET LOWERED: Cantor Fitzgerald lowered the firm’s price target on Hive Digital (HIVE) on Tuesday to $8 from $11 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. Hive said it mined 89 bitcoin during the month of February, or 3.1 bitcoin per day, a decrease from 102 bitcoin mined in January, and its share of the overall bitcoin network decreased to 0.69% from 0.73% on a peak hash rate basis, the analyst said. Cantor continues to believe that current levels represent an attractive risk/reward, as the firm is confident in Hive’s ability to execute on its bitcoin mining and AI Cloud targets, which will represent 300% hash rate growth and $100M in annualized run-rate revenue in 2025, respectively. CRYPTO STOCK PLAYS: Publicly traded companies in the space include Bit Digital, Coinbase, Core Scientific (CORZ), Greenidge Generation (GREE), Mara Holdings, Strategy (MSTR), Riot Platforms, Stronghold Digital Mining (SDIG) and TeraWulf (WULF). PRICE ACTION: As of time of writing, bitcoin dropped about 6% this week to $83,160 in U.S. dollars, according to CoinDesk.

1 Tech Stock With More Potential Than Any Cryptocurrency,"Given that Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is up an incredible 600% since August 2020, it might seem incomprehensible that any tech stock has been able to keep up with that blistering pace. But what if I told you that one tech stock is up more than 1,800% during that time period? That tech stock is Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), the company formerly known as MicroStrategy. It might be the only tech stock with more potential than any cryptocurrency. Strategy has outperformed every other company in the S&P 500 since August 2020. As seen in the chart, even tech superstar Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), up a staggering 855%, has been unable to keep up with Strategy. Strategy's impressive gains, of course, have coincided with its decision to embark on a massive Bitcoin buying binge that started in August 2020. The company has now accumulated nearly 500,000 Bitcoins, making it the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world. That's no mean feat -- it's equivalent to more than 2% of all Bitcoin in circulation. And it means Strategy holds significantly more Bitcoin than the U.S. government, which holds approximately 200,000 Bitcoins. Until 2020, Strategy was an enterprise software company. But it has now become a Bitcoin Treasury Company (BTC). According to Michael Saylor, the founder and executive chairman of Strategy, BTC refers to a company that is entirely Bitcoin-centric. It exists, quite simply, to buy as much Bitcoin as it can. The company even changed its name in February to reflect that fact. The company's brand identity now includes the iconic Bitcoin symbol, and the change from ""MicroStrategy"" to ""Strategy"" is meant to highlight how the company now only has one macro (not micro) strategy: Bitcoin. The company has gone so all-in on Bitcoin that it announced a plan at the end of 2024 to buy $42 billion worth of new Bitcoin over the next three years. It will finance half of that with equity, and the other half with debt. The decision to take on debt to buy new Bitcoin has raised more than a few eyebrows. It would be much like your next-door neighbors announcing plans to max out their credit cards, all to buy as much Bitcoin as they can. Saylor told audience members during his keynote speech at the Bitcoin 2024 event in Prague last summer that they should essentially do exactly that. A true Bitcoin maximalist, he says, should be willing to take any step possible to own as much Bitcoin as humanly possible. So what could go wrong? Well, you guessed it: The price of Bitcoin could fall, as it is doing right now. That helps to explain why the price of Strategy stock is down nearly 20% year to date. It is so highly leveraged to the price of Bitcoin that it responds to any price movement of Bitcoin in the crypto market. Some analysts and academics are now calling into question the current valuation of Strategy itself. The company is valued at significantly more than the value of its Bitcoin holdings. At a current price of $239, Strategy is currently worth $60 billion. Meanwhile, its Bitcoin holdings are worth approximately $40 billion. Keep in mind: Strategy's enterprise software unit is a money-losing business and no longer a core focus. As a result, the value of Strategy is almost entirely dependent on the value of its Bitcoin hoard. So it's not entirely out of the question to suggest that Strategy's valuation could fall further if Bitcoin continues to decline. That being said, plenty of analysts think the value of Strategy will rise over time. Those same analysts, of course, think the price of Bitcoin will also rise over time. As long as Strategy can ""out-Bitcoin"" Bitcoin, it might just be possible. The creation of a new Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by the U.S. government might just be the key to unlocking even more value at Strategy, since it would likely encourage new Bitcoin buying around the world. Not surprisingly, Saylor is now urging the U.S. government to buy 25% of all Bitcoin in circulation by the year 2035. That type of aggressive buying would surely push Strategy higher over the next decade as it rides the wave of Bitcoin price appreciation. Strategy has enormous upside potential. And you can't argue with its stock market performance over the past five years. It has been a total beast. At the end of the day, though, I'm sticking with Bitcoin. From my perspective, Strategy is too highly exposed to wild volatility swings in the crypto market. Over the long haul, I'm not convinced that any tech stock -- not even Strategy -- can outperform Bitcoin.
